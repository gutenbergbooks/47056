<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sudden interest created by recent political events in
everything relating to Cyprus, an island which, from its
geographical position, seems destined to play no unimportant
part in modern history, has rendered the appearance of Herr
von Löher’s narrative of his recent journeyings through
the length and breadth of that country extremely welcome.
It is therefore with much pleasure we have received permission
from the Author to lay before the British Public an
adaptation of his book (only published during the last few
days) which seems well suited to supply information, such as
is at present much needed in England.</p>

<p>The island of Cyprus from the first dawn of civilisation
has been classic ground, extremely interesting to antiquaries,
and its history throughout the Middle Ages is largely blended
with tales of chivalry and romantic incidents, such as in these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
matter-of-fact times are scarcely cared for by speculators,
whose object is to obtain reliable information on subjects
of more practical importance, such as the resources of the
country, the character of its soil, the capabilities of its surface,
and the industry of its inhabitants. Lessons upon these
points are only to be learned from a careful survey, such as
that accomplished by our author, who, uninfluenced by prejudice,
describes in simple narrative the actual condition of
the island, the scenery of the interior, and the everyday
employments and pursuits of the people, thus removing many
erroneous impressions as to the condition of the Cypriotes, and
leaving the reader to form his own opinion as to the status
and prospects of our new acquisition. All information
connected with these points we have carefully rendered, only
omitting such matter as appeared irrelevant, and calculated
unnecessarily to increase the size of the book. Additional
information gleaned from various sources, relative to the
general history and statistics of the island, is to be found in
the Appendix.</p>

<p>That the climate of Cyprus is delightful, the soil prolific,
and the landscape in some parts of the country of surpassing
beauty, we have abundant testimony in the writings of
classic authors, and there is no reason to suppose that in these
respects its attractions have deteriorated. A late writer,
J. Jasinides, who died at a good old age at Koutzovendi, in
Cyprus, in 1871, at the conclusion of his work “Les Iles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">vii</a></span>
Mediterranée,” thus expresses himself: “For forty years I
have been wandering from isle to isle, ascertaining their political,
commercial, and social aspect, and this island (Cyprus)
notwithstanding the barbarism of its present rulers, through
which it is cut off from the rest of the world, is my favourite....
It is a little world in itself; here do I wish to die. My
limited means will keep me in comparative luxury. Although
old, I am strong and feel young, no wild beasts or reptiles
disturb my solitude, the water is sweet and cool, the wine
is nectar, and the food plain but good; above all I know that
my grave will be respected, and that kind hands will close
my eyes.”</p>

<small><small>LARNAKA.</small></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first approach to Larnaka, the chief sea-port of
Cyprus, is well calculated to impress the traveller. The
boundless expanse of blue sky and sea, the bold outline of
the hills and mountains, brought out as they are into sharp
relief by the clearness and brilliancy of the atmosphere, seem
to throw the works of man far into the background and
boldly assert the simple grandeur of nature.</p>

<p>Such were my involuntary reflections as we dropped
anchor in the roads of Larnaka on April 21st, 1877. This
entrance to the island displays an expansive bay, the yellow
sands of which are bordered by an extensive plain, broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
by bare and rocky hills, and in the blue distance backed by
a chain of mountains. A landscape was before me, in which
the towns, gardens, and buildings constituted only minor
accessories. Larnaka appeared as a mere speck on the bosom
of the open country. The haven contains about fifty houses,
built in the centre of the curve of the bay, and above them
wave the variegated flags of the different consulates, surmounted
by pointed minarets and a new belfry. The town
of Larnaka itself lies far behind, and is separated by wide
fields from the haven. Thanks to the kindness of the
German consul, a friendly welcome awaited me at the landing-place,
where I found a dragoman ready to conduct me to my
destination. Before leaving the haven, however, I inspected
its streets, which presented an animated appearance. Artisans
plied their trades in all directions, and dirt reigned
supreme. The rows of houses interspersed with stately
mansions, churches, and gardens, filled with waving palms,
constitute its principal attractions; all else is strictly Oriental,
namely, its filth, rags, and miserable huts of wood and clay.</p>

<p>In the Catholic church, we found a solitary monk, who
showed us some fine carvings. The pictures upon the partition
which separates the altar from the rest of the church
are diligently kissed by the worshippers. I could not but
approve this custom, if only from the fact that a law of the
church required that no one should salute the sacred
pictures without previously washing his face. This ceremony
takes place once a week, so that, happily, the gold and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
silver covered panels are not distinguished by a black circle
in the spots where they are kissed. With the exception of
an occasional block of marble built into the walls of a house,
or a sarcophagus, utilised as a receptacle for water, I saw
nothing to recall the ancient power of the busy crowds that once
animated this spot. Their tombs, excavated in the stratum
of chalk, which lies below the surface, were once filled with
marble sarcophagi, which century by century have been
dragged out and employed for building purposes. Hence
the revolting name given to this town, for Larnaka, literally
interpreted, means simply a coffin. Others, however, assert
that the name is derived from the fact that the houses were
built upon the site of an ancient graveyard.</p>

<p>The Phœnicians are believed to have first founded a town
here and called it Kiti; by the Greeks it was known as
Kition, and from this source was derived the Asiatic designation
of Kitier, for the inhabitants of Cyprus. At a later
date Grecian settlers took possession of it; artists, weavers,
and artisans in large numbers poured in, and dwelt side by
side with the Syrians, but occupying their own part of the
town, gradually introducing their own language to common
use as in Antioch and Alexandria, and giving a Grecian
tone to the education of the higher classes. The Latin
tongue, on the contrary, seems never to have gained a footing
in the East. Cyprus, however, formed an exception to this rule,
and during the four centuries that the island was subject to
the sway of the Lusignan dynasty, and Venetian rule, Latin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
was in general use. Not a trace of it, however, now remains.
Modern Greek is spoken, even in most of the Turkish houses,
and is understood in every part of the country. The consulate
body in Larnaka has representatives from every state in
Europe. Its haven is the best in the island, although on
account of the shallowness of the water, vessels are compelled
to steer clear of the sand and ride at some distance from the
town.</p>

<p>The whole of this interesting island may be regarded as
one huge graveyard, the treasures of which are disclosed at
every turn of the spade. In Idalion, the Greeks, it appears,
had formerly made their graves three feet below the surface,
and, probably unknown to themselves, only some three or
four feet above those occupied by the Phœnician colonists.
In these graves, now filled up by the drifting earth of successive
centuries, are found embedded small earthen articles,
trinkets, coins, and a great variety of interesting trifles.
Amongst other articles shown me, were elegant little figures,
sucking bottles for children, and every variety of vases and
cups in clay and glass.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> What struck me most, however,
were some delicate gold chains and ear-rings, and some
yellowish blue vases of Phœnician glass.</p>

<p>Towards evening I visited the chief part of the town, which
is about a quarter of an hour’s walk from the haven, and
called upon the bishop. Here I learnt many interesting facts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>concerning the recent improvements made in means of popular
education. Until thirty years ago, schools were strictly prohibited,
whereas now, every town has its training school;
whilst in three of the chief towns, Larnaka, Nikosia, and
Limasol, these are of three grades, and in them are taught
history, geography, and Grecian literature, even to the reading
of Homer and Xenophon. The prices for these classes
are from 100 to 300 marks. Anything over and above this
charge is covered by the bishop, and a toll upon the exports
and imports of the towns.</p>

<p>I then visited the church of St. Lazarus, which is surrounded
by fine rows of pillars, with pointed arches, which
give an impressive and sacred aspect to the building. The
main part of the church is built in the form of a cross, with
a dome in the centre, and is evidently of great antiquity.
The building comprises three long large vaults, surmounted
by three small cupolas. It seems that the Pacha Kudschuk
Mehemed commanded the demolition of these domes, on the
ground that only a mosque should be so adorned, but after
long and earnest entreaties, at last yielded so far as to consent
to their being only half torn down, and the openings
filled up with planks. They were afterwards restored, and
fifteen years ago, a handsome clock tower was erected, surmounted
by the Russian double eagle.</p>

<p>When I issued from the church, evening had closed in, and
the priests, robed in black, with lights in their hands, lent an
air of solemn mystery to this fine building. St. Lazarus is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
supposed to have died in Cyprus, and his marble coffin,
adorned with one rose, stands in a narrow recess. The tomb
is empty; the bones, in all probability, having been taken
possession of by the Venetians as sacred relics. Next morning
I wandered out to explore the environs of the town. The
air was spring-like and balmy, flowers, amongst which I observed
tulips and hyacinths, enlivened the ground, and the
blue waves danced in the light of the sun. Waving palms
and high hedges of Indian cactus, hid the haven from my
sight, and lent an air of solitude and repose to the whole
scene, whilst as far as the eye could reach, the fields were
filled with fruit trees, and the landscape enlivened by flocks
of goats and sheep. The whole scene formed an Oriental
picture of great beauty, and I could not help exclaiming to
myself, “If this is the worst part of the country what a
paradise the interior must be!”</p>

<p>In the evening, having obtained the loan of a fine Arab
horse, I rode off to investigate a curious building, at no great
distance from the town. This remarkable structure, which
is half embedded in the earth and rock, resembles a baker’s
oven, and is high enough to permit a man to stand upright
within it. The sides are formed of large blocks of stone,
and the roof covered by one huge slab. This erection is
divided into three parts. A small chamber is hewn in
the bare rock, which forms a natural wall at the back of
the structure. Formerly a similar chamber opened upon the
front of the large centre portion, but this is now destroyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
These apartments seem to have been closed by slabs let down
from above into grooves, which are still visible. This ruin was
probably first used by the Phœnicians as a burial-place, and
at a later date consecrated to the virgin mother Phaneromene
Panagia. This spot has a great attraction for the peasant
women of the surrounding country, who believe that its sacred
walls possess a peculiar virtue for those suffering from grievous
sickness or for childless women. These latter often
make pilgrimages hither, carrying a lamp concealed under
their garments. At the entrance the lamp is kindled, and the
suppliant steps barefooted into the third chamber, where she
offers her prayers to Panagia, and leaves her lamp as a votive
offering. Turkish women, I am informed, also practise this
ceremony.</p>

<p>At a very short distance from this interesting relic, and
almost close to the sea, lies the celebrated lake from which
the Phœnicians extracted the salt they so largely exported.
Its value has in this respect by no means deteriorated.
During the winter rains it becomes filled with brackish water,
which evaporates as in a vast cauldron, under the burning
sun of July and August, and deposits a thick coat of fine
salt at its bottom. Night soon closes in in these latitudes,
and as I left the spot, the sun suddenly lit up sea, sky, and
earth in one blaze of glowing colour, and then rapidly sank
to rest. Darkness at once set in, and I rode home through a
silence as complete, and a solitude as profound, as if I were
traversing the open desert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span></p>

<p>The cause of unhealthiness in most towns in Cyprus is
quite local and easily removed. Thus round Larnaka and
Famagusta are marshes which infect the air, and are apt to
induce fever and ague in summer.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span></p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER II.<br /><br />

<small><small>ATHIENU.</small></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> seven o’clock the following morning I started for
Athienu, and as I passed through the streets of Larnaka,
the town was still quiet, and almost empty.</p>

<p>The better class of houses stand within a court-yard and
garden, and are furnished with large verandahs, supported
by light pillars. Women and girls of the lowest class were
to be seen lounging about the narrow, crooked streets. As I
quitted the town, the day became all that a traveller could
desire. The air was bright and pure, and a balmy breeze
swept over the green plains. The swallows were skimming
through the air, and countless larks were trilling their
sweetest notes.</p>

<p>Cyprus, I must here observe, is very bountifully supplied
with birds. I was told that many thousand larks were offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
in the market-place of Larnaka. The eggs of the partridge
are still more esteemed, and I have often heard the call of
these birds in the grass towards evening.</p>

<p>As I pursued my journey, I soon found myself between
ranges of chalk hills, and then passed for miles over bleached
and barren highlands. These form part of a chain of hills,
connected towards the south with the western range of
mountains, and extending in a long line to the sea. Very
rarely, we passed a little hut, standing in a blooming garden,
and forming a veritable oasis in this miniature desert. As I
reached the last height, I obtained a peep of the sea near
Larnaka, whilst before me, towards the northern portion of
the island, towered a superb range of mountains, bristling
with innumerable peaks, and tinted with various shades of
brown. This chain extends north of the western mountains
to the coast, where passing onwards into the sea, it forms the
groundwork of the Carpasian peninsula. To my left were also
broad, dark, stupendous mountains, running through the
whole western portion of the island. One peak, the “Troados,”
formerly the Cyprian “Olympus,” reared a snow-covered
crown. At my feet lay the extensive plains of Messaria,
watered by mountain streamlets, and forming one huge cornfield.
A group of thirteen camels, tended by two negroes,
stood in a pasture ground beneath me, and imparted a still
more Eastern character to the scene. These negroes were
probably paid servants, but formerly black slaves were commonly
employed in this island. The Government has forbidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
this traffic in human flesh; but as a negro will do a better
day’s work than five Cypriotes, their introduction is winked
at, and many are landed in the northern havens, and are
taken by night to the neighbouring mountains.</p>

<p>About noon I reached the town of Athienu, the inhabitants
of which are considerably above the average Cypriote in manliness
and intelligence. I learnt that they trace their descent
from the famous defenders of the powerful fortress, Famagusta,
which, in the Middle Ages, stood upon the western part
of the island. Famagusta is encumbered with <i>débris</i>, and
the covered pits from which the Turks assaulted the walls in
the sixteenth century, are now stagnant marshes. After the
fall of Nikosia, this fortress had resisted the Turkish arms for
more than a year, under the command of the brave Venetian
captain, Bragadino. In vain the Turkish General Seraskier
Mustapha stormed the place. Six times his men rushed on,
their swords between their teeth, fascines and ladders in their
hands, and six times they were driven back with great
slaughter. Mustapha was furious, his best troops were gone,
and he well knew his head must pay the penalty at Constantinople
should he return unsuccessful. The town was invested,
and six months later, when every scrap of food and ammunition
was exhausted, the starving people forced their captain
to surrender. Mustapha at once proposed the most honourable
terms. The garrison were to retain their arms and baggage,
and be sent in Turkish ships to Crete. Whoever
desired to go to another part of the island might do so with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
all his possessions, whilst those who preferred to remain, were
to be perfectly unmolested, both as regarded their religion
and property.</p>

<p>On the 5th August, 1571, the fortress was taken possession
of by the Turkish fleet, and Bragadino at once rode down to
the shore, accompanied by three generals, to deliver up the
keys to his captors. Over his head was a red silk umbrella,
and on his shoulders a purple mantle that swept the ground,
in token of his distinguished rank. Mustapha received him,
at first, with all honour; but in the course of conversation,
became so insolent that Bragadino replied to him in angry
terms. The four generals were at once attacked, Bragadino’s
nose and ears cut off, and his companions hewn to pieces.
Three hundred men of his garrison were mercilessly butchered,
and a scene of carnage and pillage ensued which lasted three
days. Only a small remnant of the higher classes were
allowed to escape, on condition that they should separate and
settle in the principal towns.</p>

<p>Bragadino was fastened to a rope and dropped into the
sea, from which he was again fished out, laded with two
baskets of earth and sent to the new Turkish entrenchments.
On his arrival he was seized, thrown down, and slowly tortured
to death, amidst the gibes and brutal laughter of Mustapha
and his followers. He died as he had lived, like a
hero, but this did not protect his body from insult. His skin
was stuffed with hay, placed on a cow, and led throughout
the camp and town, and was finally attached to the mast of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
Mustapha’s ship, and taken to Constantinople, where the
pitiless conqueror was received with open arms.</p>

<p>I dined at the table of an Athenitan, and have seldom been
better entertained; the room was small, but clean, and my
hostess young and charming. Our fare, which was admirably
cooked, consisted of fried eggs, roast fowl and pillau.
For dessert, oranges, artichokes, and some excellent dark wine,
were set before me. After dinner I enjoyed a refreshing
sleep, and then bidding adieu to my good hosts, proceeded on
my way.</p>

<p>Dali, the ancient Idalion, was my next resting-place; here
was formerly the Temple of Venus, now a mere heap of ruins,
but I saw little worthy of note. These plains of Cyprus are
watered by two streams, one of which flows east, and the
other west. Both are named after the towns towards which
they flow, the larger being called the Dali and the lesser the
Morfu. In ancient times these rivers were known as the
Pedias and Satrachos, and both much resemble the Nile in
appearance. During the rainy season these streams run
rapidly, spreading their yellow waters over the surrounding
country, and when they retire, leave a thick deposit of slime
or mud. I am told that the Pedias was formerly called the
Cyprian Nile. The table-like rocks of the plain of Messaria
through which I now journeyed, form a very peculiar
and interesting feature of its scenery. These rocks, called
τραωεζαι, from their table-like appearance, are considered by
the Cypriotes to be useless for agricultural purposes; I rode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
over several of them to test the truth of this assertion, and
found the chalk only visible in certain parts, the rest of the
surface being well fitted for the growth of vines and other
plants. But of what avail is it, that a few hills might be
cultivated, in a country whose fruitful plains for generations
have not been touched by a plough or hoe? Not a sheep or
goat was to be seen in the plains, once called by the ancients
μακαρια, or the blessed. Now that Cyprus again enjoys the
comforts of a judicious government, she will speedily bring
forth all the fruits of the earth with profusion. This, however,
will not be done without much difficulty and patient
perseverance.</p>

<p>A Cyprian ox! βοῦς χύωριος was the ancient nickname
conferred upon the Cypriotes in derision of their stolid obtuseness.
Dirty, but contented, they lounge through life
without making the slightest effort to improve their condition.
All emulation, or pride in their professions, seems to have
died out under the weight of a tyrannical and unsympathetic
government.</p>

<p>The following short sketch of the cultivation of Cyprus,
under the various dynasties, will show its extraordinary natural
resources, and the field for enterprise that will be opened
out under British sway:</p>

<p>During the long centuries of Byzantine rule, many circumstances
conduced to the animation of trade and proper
cultivation of the fertile soil. Cyprus was long regarded as a
veritable harbour of refuge, not only by those inhabiting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
neighbouring Asiatic continent, but by the persecuted victims
of various religious denominations, many of whom being quiet,
industrious men, settled down at once in the country of their
adoption as skilful tillers of the soil; whilst the Armenian
and Syrian refugees taught and improved the arts of trade
and commerce.</p>

<p>The introduction of the silkworm into Cyprus must,
however, be regarded as a main cause of its long prosperity.
Until that time the wearing of silk was confined entirely
to the highest classes, and it could only be procured, at
enormous cost, of merchants travelling from India and
China. In the year 557 two monks brought a quantity of silkworms’
eggs from India to offer them to the Emperor Justinian,
who, appreciating their commercial value, caused them to
be distributed over different provinces. In no place did
their culture succeed as in Cyprus; the warm soft air, rarely
agitated by wind and storm, exactly suited their requirements,
and in a very short space of time the southern coasts,
and other parts, were covered with mulberry trees for their
sustenance, and the celebrated silk factories established and
in full work. The rule of the Arab in Cyprus brought on
the contrary decadence and misfortune in its train. These
sons of the desert destroyed all before them, churches and
temples were laid in ruins, and books committed to the
flames. Once, however, settled in the conquered dominion,
they gave themselves up to the enjoyment of their new
possessions. Jews and Christians were employed in building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
new palaces, and in translating into Arabic the poetry of
Persia and works of Eastern lore. For their own share of
improvement the Arabs devoted themselves to the cultivation
of plants, and arranged splendid and well-irrigated gardens,
which they filled with trees and shrubs brought from Egypt,
Syria, and Arabia.</p>

<p>We learn that, as far as the island has been yet explored,
it contains no less than one thousand different sorts of plants.
The forest growth is more especially luxuriant. According to
Herr linger, the “Pinus maritima,” in Cyprus, covers the
hills and mountain regions to the height of 4000 feet, and one
of the commonest trees, the “Pinus laricio,” which covers all
the heights to 4000 feet above the sea, is met with on the
western mountains of the island to 6000 feet, and gives them a
dark appearance from the coast. The wild cypress, “Cupressus
horizontalis,” is the third tree which grows commonly in the
eastern part of the island, and in some places forms, by itself,
whole woods. On the entire northern chain of mountains
this wild cypress often grows at the height of 2000 feet to
3000 feet above the sea. Great forests of wild cypresses must
have covered the whole of the south of the island, interspersed
with a shrub, the “Juniperus Phœnicea.” In the north
several varieties of oak are found, and throughout the island
the arbutus abounds. The carob-tree, “Ceratonia siliqua,”
and olive flourish on the banks of all the rivers, and up to an
elevation of 1000 feet above the sea. The succulent pods of
the carob-tree are exported to Egypt and Syria, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
pulp, which is called St. John’s bread, from its resemblance
to manna, is used as an article of food. Orange and lemon
trees, and date-palms, are also met with in great profusion.</p>

<p>The cultivation of Cyprus during the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries was carried to great perfection, and
was still flourishing in the two succeeding centuries. During
the chivalrous dominion of the Lusignans, inconceivable
wealth and almost unprecedented luxury overspread the
whole island, and in all the neighbouring countries of the
Mediterranean, Cyprus was spoken of as a miniature India,
overflowing with treasure. Knights, philosophers, and
adventurers streamed into the island. The prosperity of
Cyprus must not, however, be attributed to these new and
able immigrants, but to the fact that its revenues were no
longer drained by its tributes to foreign potentates, and that
its princes ruled with prudence and justice. These new
comers to the island at once commenced cultivating the fruit
trees of their native lands. Apple, pear, plum, and medlar
trees, however, did not thrive, but cherries, peaches, bananas,
and apricots came to great perfection, and Cyprus is still
noted for its walnuts. An attempt was next made to
introduce the sugar-cane, with much success, and Cyprian
sugar was soon in great request. The art of refining had,
however, not been introduced, and the sugar only took the
form of small blackish grains.</p>

<p>The cultivation of the grape, which had dated from most
ancient times, acquired new vigour under these influences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
and was speedily recognised as the choicest vintage in the
world. In no less esteem were held the silks and velvets
woven in Cyprus, and the extended cultivation of the mulberry
and the perfection of the art of weaving went hand in
hand.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Syrian industry was united with European talent,
and operatives from Persia, who came to give their services,
brought with them seeds of the cotton-plant. So marvellously
did this new venture prosper, that cotton was commonly
known as the gold-plant, on account of its great
commercial success. In Nikosia, the capital of Cyprus,
large weaving establishments were at once formed for the
production of the fine calico, for which Cyprus was soon
noted. During the whole of the Middle Ages, Cyprus must
be regarded as the garden in which tropical plants of all
kinds were carefully acclimatised, and from thence introduced
and distributed over Greece, Italy, S. France, Spain,
the Canary Islands, and America.</p>

<p>A short distance from Nikosia, I observed a party of soldiers
standing in a court-yard on the roadside. As I approached
they quietly sprang into their saddles, and rode
towards me with their sabres in their hands. On reaching me
they saluted, and one of the party advancing, informed me,
with a graceful wave of his hand, that he had been sent by
the Pacha of Cyprus to meet and conduct me to the lodging
he had found for me. My new companion, who was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>Catholic Armenian, speaking both French and Italian,
chatted gaily to me as we rode on side by side. Our path
lay through a valley between the hills which still hid the
city from our eyes. As soon as we reached the rising ground,
hundreds of waving palm-trees were before us, interspersed
with slender minarets, whilst here and there a fine dome,
towering high, announced to me that the capital of Cyprus
lay before us. A veritable gem of Eastern beauty it looked
in the bright sunlight, its white walls and painted minarets
standing gaily out from the green, well-watered plain and
graceful palms, whilst fine belfries and Gothic churches
gave an air of grandeur to the view. As we approached the
sun went rapidly down, gold and purple clouds rolled over
our heads, and the air was filled with a soft and delicious
breeze.</p>

<p>At the gates of the town we were met by a party of
lepers begging for alms; the revolting sight seemed to throw
a feeling of horror over the whole scene. Happily the unfortunates
are not permitted to enter the city. We were now
requested to form ourselves into a file in order to make our
entrance in a becoming manner. Two soldiers went first with
naked sabres in their hands, then followed the captain, then
myself, and in my rear, our servants and baggage. In this wise
we galloped along as rapidly as our mules would carry us,
and as we passed through the bazaars and streets the people
gathered about us and offered a respectful welcome. A
narrow dirty street brought us to the door of my lodging,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
where I was received by the host and his servants with many
impressive genuflections.</p>

<p>Here I parted with my friendly conductors, after offering
them a return, in solid cash, which they evidently expected,
for their civilities. The captain of the party shortly after
returned to invite me to visit the governor, who belonged
to a noble Bosnian family, at his residence. This gentleman
had travelled much, and had visited both Paris and Vienna.
He received me with all the grace of a European, and gave me
much valuable information respecting this interesting town.
What delighted me most, however, was the gift of an excellent
map of the country, a treasure I had vainly attempted
to obtain ever since my arrival, and which proved invaluable
to me in all my journeyings.</p>

<p>As I returned home the city lay in perfect rest, not a
creature was to be seen, and the streets were only enlivened
by the gambols of a few wretched homeless dogs.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER III.<br /><br />

<small><small>NIKOSIA.</small></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> city, called by the Greeks Levkosia, and by the
Turks Lefkoscha, impressed me more than any other Oriental
town I have visited. An indescribable blending of
Eastern and Western characteristics meets the eye at every
turn, and imparts a familiar appearance to the strange and
interesting scene.</p>

<p>How shall I give an idea of the uproar that roused me
from my slumbers early next morning? Trumpets were
sounding, muezzins were chanting in drawling tones from
the tops of all the minarets, countless crows and ravens combined
with cocks and hens to outvie in their performance,
the braying of asses, and groaning of camels. Whilst over
all clanged the bells from every belfry in the city. The
following day being Easter-eve, this music commenced at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
midnight, and continued without interruption till morning,
varied, however, by the firing of every old gun that could
be mustered for the occasion.</p>

<p>In passing through the streets of the town, I observed
through the gates of the high-walled gardens many varieties
of fruit trees, apple, pear, and figs; orange, lemon, mulberry,
and pomegranate trees also lent their blossoms to give the
finishing touches to the scene. The garden walls are high, but
not so lofty as to exclude from view the slender white minarets,
dark cypresses, and waving palms that they enclose.
Half Nikosia is made up of these lovely gardens. Everywhere
water-pipes are gently pouring forth their offerings to the
thirsty ground, and the whole town is redolent of perfume.
The Cyprian sky resembles that of the Nile valley in its
cloudless, deep blue, and is equally beautiful in its clear
expanse; while as for the climate, a very few days in its soft,
delicious, balmy air makes one understand why, of all the
Grecian islands, Cyprus should have been allotted the privilege
of being regarded as the favorite residence of the
Goddess of Love. At first I felt inclined to linger in this
lovely spot and make myself acquainted with its literature;
but a nearer view showed me my time would not be profitably
spent. Society there was none, the few Europeans the
city contained being entirely engaged in striving to make
a little money.</p>

<p>Domestic life in Cyprus is generally confined within
the precincts of its beautiful gardens, and in most of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
relations is strictly Turkish. Women of the higher classes
in Nikosia wear a delicate white veil and silken garments,
instead of the bright blue, yellow, and red veil usually seen
in the other towns.</p>

<p>Dr. Clarke, in his “Travels,” says:—“The interesting
costume presented in the dress of the Cyprian ladies ought
not to pass unnoticed. Their head apparel was precisely
modelled after the kind of calathus represented upon the
Phœnician idols of the country and Egyptian statues. This
was worn by women of all ranks, from the wives of the
consuls to their slaves. Their hair, dyed of a fine brown
colour by means of a plant called ‘henna,’ hung behind in
numerous long straight braids; and, in some ringlets disposed
near the face, were fastened blossoms of the jessamine, strung
together upon strips of leaves of the palm-tree in a very
curious and pleasing manner. Next to the Calmuck women,
the Grecians are, of all others, best versed in cosmetic arts.
They possess the valuable secret of giving a brown colour to
the whitest locks, and also tinge the eyebrows the same hue,
an act that would be highly prized in London and Paris.
The most splendid colours are displayed in their habits, and
these are very becoming to the girls of the island. The upper
robe is always of scarlet, crimson, or green silk, embroidered
with gold. Like other Greek women, they wear long scarlet
pantaloons, fastened round the ankle, and yellow boots, with
slippers of the same colour. Around the neck and from the
head are suspended a profusion of gold coins, chains, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
other trinkets. About their waists they have a large belt, or
zone, fastened in front by two large and heavily-polished
brass plates. They endeavour to make the waist as long as
possible, and their legs consequently short. Naturally corpulent,
they take no pains to diminish the size of their bodies
by lacing, but seem rather vain of their bulk, exposing their
bosoms at the same time in a manner highly unbecoming.
Notwithstanding the extraordinary pains they use to disfigure
their natural beauty by all manner of ill-selected ornament,
the women of Cyprus are handsomer than those of any
other Grecian island. They have a taller and more stately
figure, and the features, particularly of the women of Nikosia,
are regular and dignified, exhibiting that elevated cast of
countenance so universally admired in the works of Greek
artists. At present this kind of beauty seems peculiar to the
women of Cyprus.”</p>

<p>The women of Nikosia walk lightly and gracefully, instead
of presenting the appearance, as do many of their country-women,
of stuffed sacks rolling along, and unlike most
Turkish ladies, can often boast neat and slender figures.
In my own opinion the town does not contain more than
12,000 inhabitants, many, however, estimate their number as
18,000.</p>

<p>In former times Nikosia was some miles in circumference
and was three times as large as it is now. Ruins of churches
and cloisters are to be seen in all directions outside the present
town. Of late years the Greek and Turkish inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
associate much more freely than formerly. Turkish servants
are often met with in Greek houses, and intermarriages are
by no means uncommon. The dress of the peasantry is
almost Turkish, and pillau, essentially a Turkish dish, is
commonly seen on every table in the island. Many of the
professed Mussulmans are actually Christians, and have their
children baptised in secret. Their forefathers were followers
of the Prophet through fear and compulsion, and it would
expose any one to much persecution and obloquy, who openly
declared that he no longer belonged to that faith.</p>

<p>During the days of Venetian rule, many Italian words
became grafted into the language, whilst French, on the
contrary, is entirely forgotten in Cyprus. In Nikosia,
the Turkish inhabitants pride themselves on the purity with
which they speak their own language; indeed, I am informed
that nowhere, except in Constantinople, can this be heard in
greater perfection. The Grecian population speak Greek.
This desire on the part of the Turks to keep their language
pure and undefiled, must be regarded as a lingering attempt
to preserve the ancient renown and dignity of Nikosia in a
time when its homes were palaces, and their inhabitants
wealthy and esteemed. Of their ancient mansions but little
is now left beyond a few stately ruins. Many of the fine old
walls have been broken down within some feet of the ground,
and upon them wretched little huts of wood and clay erected
to serve as a hasty refuge for some indigent family. If asked
why they do not bestow more care upon their houses, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
indolent workmen will inform you, that, “it is not worth while
to build better on account of the frequent earthquakes.” On
these occasions I have often felt tempted to inquire if earthquakes
were only known to the modern Cypriotes? The
ancient buildings of the island are readily recognised by
the large blocks of brown freestone of which the walls are
built.</p>

<p>The Cathedral of St. Sophia forms the centre of attraction
in Nikosia. This fine edifice is built in the Gothic style,
and richly decorated; of this ornamentation, only the carved
stone-work remains. The pillared interior of the church is
approached from the portico by three arched portals. The
walls of this noble building are decorated by whitewash,
and, to please the Turkish taste, pillars and capitals are
streaked and daubed with red, green, and yellow. Happily
the beautiful arched windows are still framed in rich carving.
The base of the bell tower is adorned with two unusually
high minarets. Close to the cathedral is the Church
of St. Nicholas, with its three noble entrance gates; here all
the niches are charmingly decorated with a living tracery
in the shape of a great variety of stonecrop. The fine
interior of this church is now used as a granary. The
Archbishop’s Chapel is another interesting building, of which
the walls are covered with ancient pictures. The archiepiscopal
throne with its gilding and the handsome altar-screen,
are but dimly seen in the mellow half light.</p>

<p>As I left the archiepiscopal chapel. I was met by a young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
priest, who brought me a friendly invitation to take a cup of
coffee with the Lord Archbishop. I had so much still to see
that I felt compelled to decline this courtesy. The young
priest modestly urged that it was the custom for all strangers
to pay their respects to his grace, and that I should not
willingly be the first to decline. My time only permitted
me to make a hurried call, which fact I, however, since,
much regretted, as I afterwards found that the head of
the Cyprian Church is a worthy and distinguished man, who
well deserves his title of μακαριωτατος.</p>

<p>A dignitary of the Greek Church may certainly be considered
as much more fortunately situated than any other
official in Europe. During his entire life he can mount a
perfect Jacob’s ladder of preferments and emoluments, and
may don every shade of colour, in robes of black, green,
yellow, and red to rich purple; he can also exhibit a variety
of crosiers and mitres. The Archbishop of Cyprus, who has
now obtained the highest rank, signs his name with red ink,
seals with the imperial double-headed eagle, carries a shepherd’s
crook, surmounted by a golden orb, and bears a title
enumerating his saintly and lordly attributes. The income
of this dignitary is derived from two sources—voluntary
offerings and tithes, and sums paid for dispensations, marriages,
and masses. The archbishop has many claims upon this
revenue, and has annually to send money to Constantinople,
the Archbishop of Cyprus being a vassal of the Sultan’s.
The four bishops of Cyprus, though chosen from its capital,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
are also compelled to obtain the consent of this potentate to
their election. The Greek priests are said to average two
per cent. of the whole population; it may therefore be
supposed that their position is a degraded one, and their incomes
very small. Many of those in Nikosia can scarcely
do more than read the services, and perform the various
ceremonies with proper intelligence and decorum, whilst
those in the village cures are so reduced that they
must often resort to the mending of shoes, and tending of
sheep and cattle, to earn a bare livelihood.</p>

<p>The church of St. Katherine, now turned into a mosque,
has a fine entrance, adorned with three arches and pillars,
with Corinthian capitals. Two stately marble columns lie
in the court-yard; these, with their fine carved escutcheons,
have been torn down by the Turks and employed as seats.
The graves of the brave defenders of the city are still held
in honour, and small cupolas are erected to mark their resting
places. The spot where the first Turk mounted and fell
when the city was stormed, is also distinguished by a small
dome. The gravestone is marble, and the coffin of wood,
overshadowed by the green flag of the Prophet. Nikosia
can boast a very unusual number of churches and mosques,
and we are told that, when the city was at the height of its
glory, there were no less than two hundred and fifty chapels
and churches. Cyprus is also especially remarkable for the
number of graves of its saints.</p>

<p>In all ages the island was regarded as a harbour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
refuge from persecution or tyranny, and its close proximity
to Syria and Palestine attracted many suffering Christians
to its shores. In the thirteenth century Cyprus possessed
no less than fourteen bishoprics, each of which
were founded on some memorable or sacred spot. Paul and
Barnabas, we know, preached the Gospel in Cyprus, and
we learn that many were turned from the error of their
ways to commence a new life. Accompanied by John, the
Apostles landed at Salamis, and travelled over the whole
island, preaching especially in the synagogues of the Greek
Jews, who were then very numerous. In Paphos they encountered
the Roman consul, Sergius Paulus, who speedily
became a convert, and here Elymas, the sorcerer, was struck
by them with temporary blindness, as a chastisement for his
endeavours to turn away their converts from the true faith.
The Apostle Saul here adopted the Roman fashion and
changed his name to Paulus. St. Barnabas afterwards
suffered martyrdom in Salamis, where he was burnt to death.
During the reign of Justinian, his grave was opened and a
copy of the Gospel of St. Matthew found lying on his breast.
Salamis was also the birthplace of the celebrated St.
Katherine.</p>

<p>The royal palace of Nikosia was built in the Norman-Gothic
style and must have been a noble edifice. With the
exception of an arched doorway, however, but little now
remains beyond the outer walls, with gaps where the windows
once were, and balconies with wooden latticework and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
wooden roofs. This palace was formerly the residence of
the pacha. During my visit to the city the gaols were full
of prisoners; the majority of these, I was told, were sent over
from Syrian prisons to work out their terms of imprisonment.
The Cypriotes themselves bore the character of being peaceable
in their habits, and not easily roused to acts of violence
and crime.</p>

<p>In the court of the palace stands a high pillar, which tradition
says criminals used to be compelled to mount before
receiving their sentences. I could fancy this ancient pillar,
ornamented with winged lions, must resemble that in the
market-place in Venice. I observed also the shattered remains
of another Venetian lion, which, a few years ago, was wantonly
destroyed by one of the pachas. Near the pillar above
alluded to are reared three gravestones, decorated with
knightly escutcheons and Latin inscriptions.</p>

<p>In the evening I dined with the pacha, a gentleman of
great intelligence, who has had a most thorough European
education. Our conversation happened to turn upon those
interesting relics of past ages. My host spoke with much
regret of the damage constantly and wantonly done to them
by Turkish soldiers, and bitterly deplored his own inability
to check their destructive propensities, which are all the more
difficult of restraint, as they proceed from religious enthusiasm;
followers of Mahommed being strictly prohibited, by
the Koran, to make any image; this prohibition being not
only confined to works of wood and stone, but including the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
precious works of the sculptor and the painter. Before quitting
this interesting city, I cannot refrain from adding the testimony
of a writer of the fourteenth century to the salubrity
of the climate around this city. “Nikosia,” he tells us, “lies
beneath the shelter of surrounding hills, and is noted for the
healthiness of its air and the purity of its balmy breezes.
For this reason it was selected as the residence of the court,
nobility, bishops, and in fact all such as were free to choose
where they might settle. Tournaments and hunting formed
Their chief amusements; leopards and a species of mountain
goat being the favourite objects of chase.” The same authority
states that the nobility of Cyprus were at that period the
richest in the world, an income of 3000 gulden being regarded
with no more respect than a few shillings would be in other
places. All these fine fortunes seem to have suffered
severely from the heavy expenses attendant on their favourite
pastimes. We are told of a count of Jaffa, that he kept
five hundred hounds and a servant for every two dogs.
Many of these nobles did not have less than two hundred
men as falconers and huntsmen. During their hunting excursions
it was no uncommon thing for them to camp out
in the woods and mountains for a month at a time, sleeping
in their tents and taking camels and mules with them,
ladened with all the necessaries of life. These nobles, we
are told, were men of education and experience, speaking
many languages and hearing all the news of the world
from the intercourse they had with the constant stream of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
travellers who visited this richly endowed and famous
land, from all parts. The same writer tells us that the
city of Famagusta was still more noted than Nikosia
for its riches, and enumerates the following instances of
reckless expenditure and rich possessions.</p>

<p>“The daughter of a citizen in this city, is stated at the
time of her betrothal to have been endowed with jewels that
exceeded in value those in the crown of the King of France.
One of the merchants of Famagusta, we are told, sold to the
Sultan, for the sum of 60,000 gulden, an imperial ball of
gold set with four fine stones, an emerald, a carbuncle, a
pearl, and a sapphire; some years after, desiring to repossess
it, he offered the monarch 100,000 gulden if he would return
it, but was refused. Of the profusion of gold cloth, rich
stuffs, and jewels of all kinds, he tells us he feels sure his
statements would be regarded as incredible. The wood of
the aloe alone, which is elsewhere regarded as very valuable,
is so common here as to be held in no esteem.”</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER IV.<br /><br />

<small><small>CYPRUS IN THE MIDDLE AGES.</small></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> standing amidst the grand relics of a past age which
meet the eye at every turn in the capital of this beautiful
island, or when wandering about its dirty narrow streets, I
could not but reflect on the manifold changes this fine city
has undergone, and picture the days when she stood in the
zenith of her fame and beauty.</p>

<p>The career of Cyprus is without a parallel in the history of
the world. Here we find established in the very heart of the
East, on Phœnician Grecian foundations, a mighty kingdom
distinguished by its high display of all that adorned the
finest age of chivalry, and in spite of all the agitations which
beset the outer world, retaining these traditions till the close
of the sixteenth century, when the Turks swept down upon
her, carrying ruin and destruction in their train.</p>

<p>It will be worth one’s while to linger for a few minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
whilst we note the history of Cyprus during these four
centuries. “This sweet island,” as the poets of the country
are fond of calling her, was for nine hundred years under the
dominion of the Byzantine kings, until in 1191 it was seized
upon in a burst of anger by our own impetuous and rash
Cœur de Lion, whose indignation had been excited by a refusal
to allow his queen, Berengaria, to land. He at once forced a
landing at Limasol, stormed the city, overthrew the prince’s
army, and overspread the whole island, compelling the people
to submit to him.</p>

<p>A prince of the house of Comnena was at this time on the
throne. Richard, for the first time aware of the value of his
new possession as a gathering point and resting-place in any
further attempts upon the Turks, and yet unable to take the
government upon his own shoulders, resolved to make money
of his lucky acquisitions, and offered the crown to Wido
(Guido) Lusignan, ex-king of Jerusalem, for the sum of
100,000 ducats. During the time of Richard’s possession he
conducted himself with much severity to the inhabitants.
Half the land was at once appropriated to the use of himself
and his followers, a certain portion was set aside for his
personal expenses and the endowment of churches and
monasteries, and the rest divided and allotted as feudal
tenures to his followers.</p>

<p>Such an El Dorado was not to be regarded with indifference
by the adventurous knights of Christendom, and numbers
followed in the wake of Richard to receive their share<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
of the titles and baronial fiefs that were being lavished
around.</p>

<p>As years went on, and one place after another was wrested
from Christendom, monks and priests, anxious to find a comfortable
resting-place, turned their steps to Cyprus.</p>

<p>Wido de Lusignan had brought no less than three hundred
knights and two hundred squires in his train. These
Knight Templars at once erected a lodge to their order in
Limasol, and twenty years afterwards their numbers had
greatly increased; some were English and German, but the
majority Italians and Frenchmen. A reign of chivalry
now arose which drew the eyes of Europe to this small and
famed island. Wido, the first king of the Lusignan dynasty,
only reigned three years, but his reign was marked by
strenuous efforts to complete the subjection of the Cypriotes
by the building of strong castles and fortresses. Order and
justice distinguished his sway.</p>

<p>Amalrick, his brother and successor, was no sooner installed
than he summoned his followers and announced his intention
of at once offering his crown as a fief to some monarch
powerful enough to protect him from all enemies. An embassy
was sent to offer allegiance to the Emperor Henry the
Sixth, of Germany, who recognised the importance of the
step, and consented to uphold Amalrick as his vassal. The
Archbishop of Trami and Brindisi was despatched to bear a
sceptre to the royal vassal, and desire that the coronation
might take place in the emperor’s presence when he visited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
the Holy Land. Amalrick, however, was averse to this
delay, and his royal master therefore consented that the
ceremony should be performed before a deputy.</p>

<p>In September, 1197, Bishop Hildesheim, the Imperial
Chancellor, arrived, and received the oaths of the new king.
The coronation was then celebrated before him in the principal
church in Nikosia. Now commenced a long career of
knightly deeds and chivalrous enterprises, led under the banner
of the King of Cyprus, and many notable feats were
performed by sea and land.</p>

<p>From 1285 to 1373 must be regarded as the most glorious
period of this career of enterprise, the reigns of Henry the
Second, Hugo the Fourth, and Peter the First being particularly
distinguished in the annals of the times; Smyrna
and Alexandria were conquered, and the emirs upon the
coast compelled to pay tribute.</p>

<p>At this epoch, Cyprus was the centre of Eastern commerce,
and merchandise was brought thither from Asia and Europe,
either for exchange, or to be forwarded to other hands. The
towns of Limasol, Paphos, and Keryneia, were crowded with
merchandise from Constantinople, Beyrout, Damascus, and
Alexandria, from Venice, Pisa, Genoa, Barcelona, and Marseilles.
Famagusta was regarded as the principal mart of
the Mediterranean, and a constant stream of pilgrims enlivened
all the havens of Cyprus.</p>

<p>With the improved cultivation of the land and such developed
commerce large sums of money were made, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
proportion as the wealth of the island increased an equal
change in its inhabitants arose, and self-indulgence and cross
extravagance began to sap the strength of the upper classes.
The highest prosperity of Cyprus may be said to have continued
for two hundred years. In 1337 its misfortunes recommenced.
The Genoese fell upon the island and met with
little or no resistance from the inhabitants, who were quite
unprepared for the attack. Famagusta became the head-quarters
of these merciless oppressors, who at once stretched
forth an iron hand upon the trade of the country. Cyprus
never rallied from this blow. A feeble attempt was made
to drive out the invaders, but the Genoese called in the
assistance of the Egyptian Mamelukes, who compelled the
Cypriotes to pay them tribute.</p>

<p>Now arose a scene of anarchy and rapid decline; every
man’s hand was against every man, and private revenge took
the place of law and order. The interposition of the
Venetian rule at this time must be regarded as a decided
improvement on such a state of things. Katherine, the
daughter of a lofty Venetian patrician, was given in marriage to
James, the now insignificant prince of the unfortunate island,
and jointly shared his throne. The marriage was celebrated
in 1471, and the Venetian Senate adopted the queen as a
daughter of St. Mark. In 1473 James died, and the Venetian
Government at once assumed charge of his son. This
child, however, dying, Katherine was persuaded by the
Senate to abdicate in their favour. Meanwhile Charlotte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
Lusignan, only daughter of John the Third, who had married
her cousin Louis, son of the Duke of Savoy and Anna
of Cyprus, went to reside in Rome, where she died in 1487,
bequeathing her claims to Charles Duke of Savoy, in consequence
of which the sovereigns of that dynasty assumed the
titles of kings of Cyprus and Jerusalem. (This interesting
fact will explain the feeling with which our interference with
the island has been regarded in Italy). The Venetian rulers
at once attempted to restore order and foster expiring commerce,
but without much success.</p>

<p>In 1571 the last traces of Cyprian glory disappeared under
the blighting shadow of the Turkish banner. The people
did not surrender without a struggle, but they were much
enfeebled, and their Venetian rulers had already more possessions
than they could maintain by force of arms. All
Europe trembled before the successful troops of Suliman the
Third. In 1566 the Cypriotes were commanded to fortify
their capital, the city was to be reduced to a third of its then
size, and surrounded by walls, moats, and eleven bastions, all
buildings beyond these limits to be destroyed. The nobility
and people willingly obeyed, and consented not only to execute
the order, but bear all attendant expenses. Mansions
and villas were torn down to make way for the new fortresses.
Even the Dominican cloister, which contained the graves of
their kings, was sacrificed, and of the eleven gates that then
surrounded Nikosia only three were allowed to remain
standing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<p>Selim the Second, Suliman’s successor, had a strong taste
for Cyprian wine, the companion in his carousals being a
Portugese Jew called Miguez Nassy. This man had once
professed Christianity, but had found it convenient to renounce
his faith. He is said to have incited Selim to put his
son on the throne of Cyprus. In order to accomplish this
end Selim appeared before Limasol in 1570, with the Turkish
fleet. The arsenal in Venice was set in flames at this time;
this act is supposed to have been committed by incendiaries
sent thither by Nassy for that purpose. The Venetians in
Cyprus had no force to withstand the Turkish troops, and the
Cypriotes were too spirit-broken to fight for the land that
was only cultivated to enrich their merciless taskmasters.</p>

<p>The Proveditore, Nicolaus Dandolo, decided to surrender
the whole of the island, with the exception of Famagusta
and Nikosia. The Turks landed without further hindrance
and marched at once to the capital with 100,000 men, whilst
their fleet kept guard, lest assistance might be sent from
Europe. For seven weeks the city sustained the siege, and
the nobility, ably supported by the lower orders, bore themselves
like brave but desperate men. Twice the Turks led
an assault, and twice were gloriously repulsed, until they
were obliged to send for a reinforcement of 10,000 men,
including many sailors, to aid them in the desperate struggle.
The bold defenders of the capital were at no time more than
100,000 strong.</p>

<p>In the night on the 9th of September began the third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
general storming of the doomed city. The whole army threw
itself as one man against the walls, and before sunrise three
bastions were in the enemy’s hands; 20,000 men fell at the
first shock, but their places were soon filled by those who
pressed behind. The unfortunate women, as soon as they
saw that all was lost, flung themselves in numbers from the
roofs of the houses, and many daughters, we are told, met
their death at the hand of their father or mother to save them
from a worse fate. The carnage and work of destruction
lasted for eight days, and when it ceased, what had once been
a fair city was a mere open space, covered with blackened
ruins, with only its still towering cathedral dome looking
down upon the scene. Two thousand Turks remained to keep
possession, whilst the rest of the army marched on to
Famagusta.</p>

<p>Nikosia was in the hands of the Mussulmans, and the last
Christian city in the East entirely destroyed. Enormous booty,
comprising an immense amount of jewels, gold cloth, and
fine works of art, and nearly a thousand of the fairest and
noblest maidens, were put on board three ships to be sent to
Constantinople, as tribute from Cyprus to the Sultan. A
Greek lady on board; preferring death to the fate that
awaited her, found her way to the powder magazine, which
she ignited. The ship at once exploded, setting fire to its
companion vessels, which were also totally destroyed; only a
few sailors saved themselves by swimming. Four years later
Sultan Selim, having enjoyed the choicest Cyprian wine to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
his heart’s content, happened one day to take a fuller cup
than usual before entering his bath, his foot slipped and his
skull was fractured on its marble floor. He only survived
this accident eleven days.</p>

<small><small>DRAWING UP OF THE STATUTES.</small></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> will now give our readers a brief sketch of the position
held by the various classes during these three centuries.
The knights and citizens, the former principally French and
Italian by birth, and the latter Greeks, Romans, Syrians, and
Jews, were free. The patrician families in the towns took
rank with the knights, and the household slaves were under
the protection of the Government. The peasantry, on the
contrary, were all held in bondage, and may be divided into
three classes. The first class gave their lord two days’ service
in the week, paid a poll-tax, and a third of all profits. The
second class only paid the poll-tax, but were compelled to
remain upon the land, whilst the third class (ελευθερα) were
free to change their master, but were compelled to pay the
half of their earnings to the lord under whose protection
they preferred to live.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p>

<p>The king held his crown in the character of vassal to the
German Emperor, and the heir-apparent was called Prince of
Antioch. The chief officials of the crown were the Seneschal,
Marshal, Chamberlain, and Constable; after them came the
baronial vassals (<i>les hommes du royaume</i>), and next in order
their dependents (<i>les hommes liges</i>). The barons were privileged
to carry a square banner, with the motto “Cour, coin,
justice,” to indicate that they enjoyed the homage and tribute
of their serfs, and had power to chastise the latter by
right of law. The eldest son inherited the fief, and in default
of male issue, the eldest daughter. Homage had to be rendered
for feudal tenure, and was performed in this wise:
The vassal, male and female, knelt before the king, who took
their hands in his own, whilst they declared themselves his
true vassals, “ready to protect and revenge him to their last
breath.” To which the king replied: “In God’s name and
my own I receive your homage.”</p>

<p>If the vassal was a lady above twelve years old, her feudal
lord was obliged to give her the choice of three knights, one
of whom she must marry within a given time; should she
refuse, her fief was forfeited for a year and a day, and she
was called upon every year to yield until she was sixty years
of age. Should the feudal chief on the contrary neglect this
part of his duty, the lady was privileged to demand a choice
of three knights, and bestow her hand on the one she preferred.
All the barons appeared at stated times at the high
court, accompanied by their vassals. In these assemblies all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
kind of weighty business was discussed in presence of the
king, disputes arranged, and sentences of death passed for
heavy crimes. There was also a lower court for the decision of
legal suits. One of the decrees is worthy of note: “Whoever
shall appear in this court and bear false witness, be he
the noblest in the land, he shall lose his head.” The court
was composed of the king’s vicomte or deputy, and twelve
sworn justices chosen from the free citizens. All questions
of the privileges of the citizens and commercial rights, as
well as of theft and falsehood, were brought before this
court. The laws and statutes in force were contained in a
volume called “The Assizes of Jerusalem,” the “Livres des
Assises et Bons Coutumes,” a splendid memorial of painstaking
wisdom and anxious thought.</p>

<p>It has been stated that this fine collection of statutes was
compiled by Godfrey de Bouillon, with the assistance of the
wisest and noblest of his followers, after the conquest of
Jerusalem. This was most probably a mere fable. Certain,
however, it is that a double volume of laws, one for the
upper, and the other for the lower court, was compiled in
Jerusalem, inscribed in large letters, and sealed by the king,
patriarch, and vicomte. This work was enclosed in a chest
and deposited in the church of the Holy Sepulchre. It was
decreed that the volume should not be taken from the chest
except in the presence of those who had signed it, two priests
belonging to the church, and four magistrates.</p>

<p>This collection of statutes was also known as the “Lettres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
du Sépulcre.” After the loss of Jerusalem this volume disappeared,
but the same statutes were enforced in the high
court at Akkon or Ptolomais, and were adopted in Cyprus.
From thence they were taken to Constantinople in 1204,
and to the Morea in 1210.</p>

<p>In the schools of jurisprudence in Nikosia the statutes contained
in the “Assizes of Jerusalem,” were brought to great
perfection with the aid of many able and leading men in the
island; of these latter a long list of names has been preserved.
The founder of this famous school of law, John d’Ibelin,
Baron of Beyrout, was called John the Old, to distinguish
him from his nephew, who bore the same name.</p>

<p>This noble, and Philip of Navarre, who boasted of having
been present at every siege and attack of any importance in
his time, were the most celebrated of this noteworthy group
of public benefactors. Amongst other names, were those of
Ralph of Tiberias, Godfrey le Tort, Gerard of Montreal, and
John of Ibelin, Count of Jaffa and Askalon, and nephew of
John the Old. The elder Ibelin and Philip of Navarre had
been leaders in the long and bloody strife in which French
chivalry in the East had frustrated the plans of the Emperor
Frederick the Second,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> who was anxious to combine the
political and military strength of Cyprus under his own
imperial rule.</p>

<p>All the other knightly law-makers above enumerated, took
part in this war. This emperor, who had already overcome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>the unruly nobility of his Italian dominions, had attained so
high a reputation for wisdom and justice during his sojourn
in the East, that many of the highest in rank and intellect
supported his claims either openly or secretly. Philip of
Navarre, who had diligently searched through many collections
of laws, set himself to obtain all possible assistance from the
law courts of Nikosia, Akkon, and Beyrout, and completed
his arduous labours by arranging his materials into one
grand statute book. This valuable work was afterwards
considerably improved and enlarged by John of Ibelin.
Like the “Lettres du Sépulcre,” this work was sealed up and
placed in the cathedral in Nikosia, and might only be opened
in the presence of the king and four barons: In this volume
we find the entire code of the Middle Ages, and might take
to heart many a lesson from the careful wisdom and far-seeing
acuteness with which its laws were compiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER VI.<br /><br />

<small><small>SAN CHRISOSTOMO.</small></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cyprus</span>, the most eastern island of the Mediterranean,
must be regarded as belonging to Western Europe, if we are
to class it by its architecture, its Gothic cathedrals, lordly
castles, and ruined abbeys; yet its mountain ranges would
seem to connect it with Syria and its open plains with Egypt.
Of all the ruins of the age of chivalry, that of the castle of
Buffavento, “the defier of storms,” is certainly the noblest
and most interesting. Never, even in Spain or Italy, have
I seen a finer combination of rugged grandeur and romantic
charm than is to be found in this extensive ruin. Most
ancient castles stand on an eminence of some few hundred
feet, but the crest of Buffavento is reared as high as the
Lion Mountain, a dark rocky pyramid 3000 feet above the
level of the sea. Early on the morning of the 24th of April<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
I rode forth followed by my dragoman, zaptieh, and other
servants, to visit this interesting ruin, the foot of the
mountain on which it stands being about four leagues from
Nikosia. My dragoman and I carried our guns with us, and
as we left the town were at once stopped by some soldiers
who wished to take them from us, it not being legal, they
told us, for foreigners to carry arms in Cyprus.</p>

<p>After a lengthened parley, and many assurances from my
men that I was under the protection, and a personal friend, of
the pacha’s, we were allowed to proceed, and went on our
way rejoicing. Our road now lay through the broad and fruitful
plain of Messaria: golden corn was waving in the breeze,
and not a living creature was visible on the vast expanse; only
the song of the lark was to be heard as it rose and fell in the
blue sky above us.</p>

<p>It was still early morning, and the Cypriotes have an
opinion that it is not safe to visit their fields and pastures till
later in the day. The silence was so intense as to be almost
painful, and the lovely landscape did not seem to coincide
with the death-like quiet that reigned around.</p>

<p>We passed two small villages, which appeared deserted, but
for the crowing of a cock which was perched on a mud wall.
When we reached Manilia, we had to ride through the bed of
the ancient river Pedias, the water of which, it being the end
of April, was low enough to admit of our crossing in safety.
As we landed on the other side, we saw, for the first time that
day, some labourers in the fields. These were the four wives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
of an amply bearded old Turk, who calmly smoked his pipe,
keeping his eye on his family meanwhile, to see they did not
shirk their work, which consisted of lopping off the ears of
corn with a small sickle—mere child’s play. As we approached
the old man shouted out something to his better halves, and
one of them, a negress, immediately threw part of her garment
over her face, and turned away. With the other three,
however, curiosity overcame their bashfulness, and their veils
were only slowly drawn down after we had enjoyed a good
look at their very ordinary faces. As we continued our way,
the line of mountains that bordered the coast lay before us in
an uninterrupted line, thirty leagues in length, forming a
natural bulwark along the northern portion of the island,
and terminating in the Carpasian peninsula. This range reminded
me of the Vosges mountains, but is much more varied
in form, and is far richer in its productions.</p>

<p>The highest peak of this range is only from 2000 to 3000
feet high, but passing as it does through an extensive open
plain, the effect of its height is very deceptive, the mountains
appearing very much higher than they actually are. The
crests of this range display every form of rocky beauty, and
its peaks, chasms, precipices, and bold bluffs are covered in
some parts with tints of reddish brown, and in others with a
purplish blue mist that gives them an indescribable charm
which I have never seen elsewhere. As we approached these
mountains, the ground rose gradually, and we perceived the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
rocks were quite bare, every variety of tint being produced
by the play of the sunbeams on the rugged stones.</p>

<p>We now drew nigh the monastery of St. Chrisostomo, and
very refreshing was the sight of its walls standing embowered
in green trees at the base of bare and rugged mountains.
Olive-trees were planted in some of its declivities, and oleanders,
which had finished flowering, bordered a small rivulet.
Everything around seemed to woo us to repose; the air was
fresh and balmy, and from the mountain height we heard
from time to time the tinkle of the bells of the sheep and
goats browsing down below. Two old monks stood at the
door to bid us welcome, and insist upon our dismounting and
accepting their hospitality. These appeared to be the only
inhabitants of the half-ruined pile. I have since learnt that
the number of monks is steadily decreasing in all the
monasteries of Cyprus. In the cloister garden were three
lofty cypresses, and a fine palm-tree. Masses of ivy were clinging
about the branches of the old apple and orange-trees. This
garden is at the height of 1300 feet above the sea, backed by
a wall of rock fully 2000 feet high. The eye turned with
relief from this vast, lofty, and rugged expanse, and the dry
parched plain beyond, to the soft green of the shady garden,
and its rippling water.</p>

<p>The two old men appeared delighted to meet with an
inhabitant of the outer world, and earnestly pressed me to
remain for some days. My time was too valuable even for
lingering in this delightful retreat. Our fare consisted only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
of vegetables. Cyprian monks would appear to be always
fasting—one day they eat turnips and onions, and on the next
pumpkins and beans. This fashion is none of the pleasantest
in a country where the monasteries are the only houses of
entertainment that are always open. As soon as my hosts
learnt I was a Bavarian, they informed me that the celebrated
Maria of Molino was the foundress of their monastery, and a
Bavarian by birth. I think the simple-hearted creatures had
a sort of vague idea that she must have been an ancestress
of my own. Dinner over, I seated myself in a cool corner,
but was at once entreated, with outstretched hands, to take
another place, as I was still warm after my journey. This is
always the way in the East. If you are tired and heated, you
must not drink, you must not sleep, and above all, in Heaven’s
name! never sit in a draught, without you want to have fever.
The only thing you are permitted to do is to throw a covering
over you and wait till you are cool.</p>

<p>These constant precautions are no doubt necessary in these
climates, still they produce an impression that danger is
always at hand. This monastery of St. Chrisostomo, which
was, probably, founded at a very early date, contains an
ancient picture of Panagia. Great additions have been made
to the original edifice, including a fine entrance and portal.
The church is formed by two chapels with cupolas. At the
time of my visit the floors of the chapels were thickly strewn
with branches of myrtle in celebration of the feast of Easter.
It is probable that Mary of Molino only beautified this edifice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
and increased its revenues. Tradition says that the unfortunate
saint being a leper, was advised by St. Chrisostomo to
bathe in the rivulet in the monastery garden. She did so,
and was healed; her gratitude being shown by munificent gifts
to the brotherhood. Certain it is that two hundred years
ago crowds of lepers visited this spot, in order to wash in the
monastery stream, to be cured of their fearful disease. This
pilgrimage is now never undertaken, either because the water
is not as abundant as in days gone by, or because happily this
hideous malady is comparatively rare. During my stay in
Cyprus I did not see one leper except outside Nikosia. This
same Mary of Molino, whose bones lie in these mountains, according
to another tradition, built the castle of Buffavento,
choosing this elevated situation, we may suppose, to remove
herself entirely from the haunts of men. If she executed such
an undertaking, she must have enjoyed the revenues of a
princess. Looking up at this grand old pile one is struck by
its strength and size, and when, on closer survey, one finds
that two similar fortresses are situated on the same chain of
mountains, at about four leagues right and left of Buffavento,
called respectively Kantara and St. Hilarion, that these castles
command the mountain passes and the roads to the city of
Keryneia, and that this town had the best haven on the north
side of the island, one is naturally led to conclude that these
fortresses were in fact erected by some enterprising conqueror,
in order to hold the whole island under his control. Buffavento,
perched high upon the Lion Mountain, looks down upon its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
companion fortresses with the air of a defiant spirit gazing
down upon the country that it formerly kept in check. On
my inquiring of my hosts if any one ever climbed to the
castle, they assured me the ascent was some thousand feet
high, and that they had no guide to assist me. Their awestruck
manner whilst speaking of such an attempt led me to
suppose that they fancied the ruins were infested by evil
spirits. They, however, informed me that ten years ago two
Germans attempted the ascent, and that the younger of the
two reached the top. This was no doubt the traveller
Kotschy, an account of whose ascent is given by his companion
Unger.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Encouraged by this report, I determined
to make the attempt myself.</p>

<small><small>BUFFAVENTO.</small></small><a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> road (with my servants we were a party of four) lay
now for half a league along the declivity, our path appearing
and disappearing at frequent intervals. As we passed along
I observed many bee-hives. These were formed by earthen
pots placed one upon another, with a small hole at the side.
Close against a rocky flight of steps we found a small building
in ruins. Here, I am told, there was formerly a garden,
so lovely that it was known as “Paradise,” Buffavento was
previously called “the Queen’s Castle,” Castello de Regina,
from its having been a favourite resort of the island queens
during the hot season. We can well imagine that whilst
they held court above, their knights and squires had jovial
times in the neighbouring monastery of San Chrisostomo.
When we reached the house called “Paradise,” I dismounted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>and looked around. Certainly the spot was one on which the
eye loved to linger. Formerly the mountain was covered
with trees, which have now disappeared. Below lay rippling
waters and fertile pastures, and in the background
the beautiful capital of the island. As I looked I saw in the
distance a shepherd boy, who, it occurred to me, might be
willing to act as guide in our adventurous undertaking. My
zaptieh galloped after him and brought him to me. The
young peasant seemed to regard the matter as an excellent
joke, and willingly agreed to conduct us, honestly assuring
us, however, that he had never yet reached the summit himself.
Our guide at once commenced mounting with the
agility of a young goat, and I followed in his wake, whilst
behind came my dragoman and zaptieh, groaning and panting,
with drops of anguish upon their brows. My heart beat
with delight when, after half an hour’s climbing, we reached
the mountain’s ridge, and looked down from a precipice several
thousand feet high, broken in all directions by enormous
clefts and gullies, whilst beyond lay a broad expanse of blue
sea. The coast from here is about a league from the foot of
the mountain, and every inch of the ground is valuable.
Gardens, orchards, and meadows extended formerly in all
directions. Along the coast are small villages, lying, as is
very unusual in Cyprus, so near, that I could see from the
one to the other. In this narrow strip of country are still to
be found some traces of the ancient beauty and fertility of
this neglected island. This is certainly rightly regarded as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
the richest district in Cyprus, whilst its fine sea breezes and
numerous mountain streams render it one of the healthiest.
My gaze lingered long on Keryneia, whose elevated fortress
formed a most striking object on the line. Directly
beneath us, so close that I could have dropped a stone upon
it, lay Bellapais embedded in olive-trees, the finest monastic
ruin I am told in Cyprus. Cloisters, refectory, and the
knight-chamber are still recognisable. The abbot was
entitled to carry the spurs and dagger of a knight, and
his monastery was a favourite resort of crusaders and pilgrims.
As I turned towards the interior of the island, I
beheld a broad expanse glowing in the sunlight. This,
the extensive plain of Messaria, occupies nearly half of the
island, and two centuries ago was one huge highly-cultivated
field, filled with corn, vines, fruit, and vegetables. Numerous
cotton and silk weaving establishments also formerly flourished
here. Every year this once fruitful plain becomes more unfit
for cultivation, and stones and marshes usurp what was once
a scene of the highest cultivation. Nothing fills the mind of
the traveller in Cyprus with sadder reflections than the sight
of this general ruin and rapid decay.</p>

<p>I now commenced climbing the precipitous mountain before
me, which towered aloft in rugged majesty, stretching its
peaks and precipices to the right hand and the left. My
dragoman endeavoured to follow me, but sank down in
dismay at the task before him. Indistinct murmurings
reached my ear, and I have no doubt that if I could have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
heard his words, they were not prayers for my success, but
maledictions on my adventurous head. I believe he and my
zaptieh were fully convinced that my ascent was made in the
hope of finding concealed treasure; for when at last they
reached the ruin, my slightest movement was jealously
watched, and my every act evidently regarded with suspicion.
We entered the ancient fortress by an arched doorway,
which is still in good preservation, and mounted slowly
from one ruin to another; many of the chambers in these
being mere excavations in the solid rock, and resembling
bakers’ ovens in appearance.</p>

<p>In such places as the nature of the rocks would permit,
hollow basins were formed and channels cut to receive the
springs that then flowed in all directions on the mountain.
We came upon several of these receptacles, and saw traces of
what had evidently been much more important water tanks.
In the fortress itself, comparatively slight walls were interspersed
with rude masses of masonry, and both were cemented
to their foundations by mortar, literally as hard as stone.
The ruin appeared to consist of six divisions rising one above
the other, and all connected by the ramparts. Such a fortress
could never have been reduced as long as its defenders
had bread and wine enough to support life. Perhaps there
are few stranger scenes than that of a ruin situated thus in
mid-air. Danger in climbing there was none, beyond the
risk of slipping, as we seized at a piece of old masonry in
mounting from rock to rock and tower to tower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<p>One of the principal towers is still in tolerable preservation,
and to this I at once ascended, and was more than rewarded for
the attempt. Before me lay on the one side an awful precipice,
at the foot of which stretched green plains and a broad expanse
of sea, and on the other side a sunny plain extending
to the lofty mountains of the western part of the island with
Mount Troados showing its snow-capped head. On one side
a wall or rock rose towering towards the sky and hid a portion
of the coast from my view. Observing the summit of this
rock attentively, I felt convinced that I could discern a building
on its peak. My servants were tired and refused to
assist me in any further explorations. Formerly, no doubt,
this eminence had been reached by means of wooden bridges,
but no trace of them was left, and a sheer and rugged wall
towered above us and presented the appearance of being perfectly
inaccessible. In vain I sought for anything like a
foothold. At last a bright idea flashed upon me; I seized our
guide by his shoulders and pointing out the building at the
summit of the rock, put my arms about a block of stone,
mounted upon it by this means, and then again pointed to
the summit. The boy laughed and nodded, and, without a
moment’s hesitation, commenced scrambling up the face of
the rock, pausing as he every now and then reached a safe
footing, to look down upon us after the manner of the
mountain goat, whose agility he emulated. My zaptieh
gazed upon me with a countenance highly expressive of the
conviction that all chance of his sharing any hidden treasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
I might find was now over; but I have no doubt comforted
himself with the hope of getting from the boy a full account
of all that was done above. I now commenced following
my nimble guide, and, thanks to a steady head, found the
attempt by no means as dangerous as it had appeared from
below; reaching the summit considerably sooner than we
anticipated. Here I found a tower and the remains of a
wall with apertures where windows had once been, and
chambers excavated in the rock. The view from this point
amply repaid me for all my exertions. A long greenish
yellow line of coast lay between the sea and the mountain,
whilst the towering rocks of Asia Minor were visible on the
horizon. At first they appeared like clouds, but gradually I
distinctly recognised the Caramanian range and the Cilician
Mount Taurus, and could distinguish their various outlines
and fields of snow.</p>

<p>The most remarkable feature in this scene, however, was
the range of mountains on which I stood, and of which the
peak of Buffavento, rising some 3000 feet above the sea,
appeared the highest point. Seen from this view the ranges
resembled enormous furrows, extending along the coast and
stretching far into the sea. The narrow neck of land, the
tongue of the island, as the Greeks call it, which extends
towards the opposite continent, forms the Carpasian peninsula.
The inhabitants of this part of the island are of fairer complexion,
and are stronger, and of more lively disposition
than the rest of their countrymen; they have also, we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
told, many customs peculiar to themselves. It is supposed
this peninsula was formerly colonised by a band of German
crusaders. In St. Andronika a fête is annually held in
honour of a German lady, who came over from Syria and
settled in this spot, where she lived as a recluse, and died in
the odour of sanctity. Other authorities tell us that many
traces of ancient Greek are to be met with in the dialects
spoken by the inhabitants, which are quite unknown to the
languages spoken in other parts of Cyprus. A gentleman
who visited this peninsula informed me that the people are
very inhospitable, dirty, and shy of strangers. Their food
consists principally of barley bread; their clothes are made
of sackcloth, and their dwellings formed in caves, in the rocks,
and other equally wretched situations, and are without either
tables or beds. The north-western declivities are covered
with fig-trees. Altogether, the description did not tempt me
to make my own observations in this, but rarely-explored
spot. As I descended from my lofty perch I noticed that the
walls and towers had been blown up with gunpowder. This
was done by the Venetians, shortly after they took possession
of the island. In 1489 they proceeded to destroy all
the noble castles and fortresses of the interior, in the fear
that they might be used as strongholds in case of rebellion
against their rule. These fortresses were, therefore, thrown
down as dangerous, and useless to the Venetians themselves,
whose fine fleet enabled them to land men at any part of the
island. Some few fortresses, however, on the coast, such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
Famagusta, were kept in tolerable repair. The crown lands
were put up for sale to the highest bidder, and were, in
many instances, bought by the lower class of nobles, who in
this manner became a power in the land, opposed to the
barons of long descent, who had been the pride of Cyprus
under the dynasty of Lusignan. These latter felt themselves
highly injured, but what could they do? The Venetian
senate gave them the title of allies, and made no attempt to
interfere with the book of statutes, but left the barons no
occupation beyond that of hunting and feasting. They,
therefore, retired to their castles or abbeys, and commenced
leaving the country. The Venetians had rendered Cyprus
defenceless and taxed her so heavily that a strong desire
arose among the inhabitants for a change of government.
Such were the destroyers of Buffavento; as to who actually
built the noble fortress in such a commanding situation
opinions greatly differ.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER VIII<br /><br />

<small><small>TURKISH GOVERNORS.</small></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">I had</span> scarcely reached my lodging in Nikosia when the
pacha came to return my visit, accompanied by his dragoman
and first secretary. He inquired with great interest
what I had been doing since we met, and seemed much
surprised on hearing that I had reached the summit of
Buffavento, he having always been given to understand that
it was quite inaccessible. In the evening I called upon him,
and we talked far into the night on the history of the past.</p>

<p>My kind friend had travelled far and read deeply, and in
all points of political history showed himself an excellent
authority. As we sat chatting I could not help contrasting
this highly educated gentleman with the pachas who formerly
inhabited his palaces. Only 101 years ago a most curious
scene was enacted under this very roof.</p>

<p>In July, 1764, there came to Cyprus as governor, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
necessitous and avaricious man, named Izil Osman Aga.
The first decree he issued was to the effect that every Christian
should pay him 44-1/2 piastres (10 francs); and every Mussulman
22 piastres (about 5 francs). This impost was exactly
double the usual poll-tax required from the subjects by their
governors. The begs, agas, and bishops assembled shook
their heads and declared the charge to be beyond the capacity
of the people. Izil Osman Aga replied that the money
must be forthcoming, and sent out officials in all directions
to make fresh extortions. All remonstrances were met by
the remark, that if the people considered he was acting
illegally they were at liberty to report him at Constantinople.
Deputies were, therefore, sent at once to the Bosphorus.
Week after week passed but nothing was heard of these
emissaries. The bishops, after some consideration, decided
to follow the delegates, but were seized and prevented by the
governor from executing their plan. In the mean time
the unfortunate citizens secretly found a powerful advocate
at Constantinople, and on October 31st an emissary from the
Grand Vizier landed in Cyprus, cited the governor to appear
before him in his palace, at Nikosia, to receive the commands
of his prince. These commands were threefold: he was to
return half the poll-tax, his other extortions were to be
inquired into, and his advisers punished. Izil Osman Aga
affected to apologise, and suggested that it would be more
worthy the dignitary who had to reprimand him if he were
to read his decrees publicly in the state-chamber of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
residence, before the assembled body of his accusers. On
this suggestion the Tschokodar<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> invited begs, agas, bishops,
and noble Greeks to attend. On the 5th of November these
assembled, followed by a dense crowd, who filled the grand hall,
and crowded the courts and staircases. At least three hundred
people were in the chamber, and on every countenance
commendation of the Sultan’s justice was to be read. The
Tschokodar seated himself beside the governor, on the divan,
which was placed at the upper end of the hall, drank his
coffee, and after handing his cup to an attendant, began
his announcement. The first sentence was read and the
people nodded their approval, when suddenly the entire floor
gave way directly in front of the divan, and the whole crowd
fell pell-mell into the space below. Cries and shrieks filled
the air. Shaken and bruised the frightened crowd scrambled
to their feet, for the fall had not been great, and a few broken
legs was all the damage done. When the three hundred victims
of this strange occurrence had recovered themselves, they proceeded
to investigate the cause of the accident; a very simple
explanation was at once discovered—all beams and supports
below the floor of the state-chamber had been sawn away, and
were ready to fall the moment a cord was pulled. Cries of rage
and vengeance resounded through the streets, and all agreed
that the governor had contemplated nothing less than the
destruction of the whole assembly; the Tschokodar also felt
uneasy, for certain sharp pains felt after drinking his coffee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>led him to suppose that it had been poisoned. Under these
circumstances a protocol was drawn up by the Tschokodar,
mollahs,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> kadis, and other citizens of rank, containing a
statement concerning the accident in the state-chamber,
requiring the governor to answer for it to them. Their messenger
was received with mockery and insult: a second and
a third delegate were sent, but with the same result. The
mollahs pronounced the governor an offender against the law
and the Sultan.</p>

<p>Scarcely was this sentence declared than the populace
rushed to the palace. The governor, however, had foreseen
this. All the entrances were closed and soldiers with guns
in their hands placed at the open windows, who shot down
any men who ventured to approach as coolly as if they had
been cocks and hens. Enraged beyond endurance the people
now rushed on, and a fight ensued which raged for two
hours. At last bundles of straw and brushwood were placed
against the grand entrance and ignited. In a very short
time the door gave way and the people crowded in, killing
all they found, amongst them the governor himself. Nineteen
of his attendants fell on this occasion and the rest found
safety in flight; the treasury was rifled and everything of
value secured. This done the crowd quietly returned home.
In three hours time the town looked just as usual, and
the Grecian feast of St. Demetrius was carried on next day
as if nothing had occurred. Five days later the Tschokodar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>returned to Constantinople, leaving perfect order and discipline
behind him.</p>

<p>So matters stood till the following year, when a new
governor, Hafiz Mahommed Effendi, landed; a shrewd and
prudent man, who speedily won the confidence of his people.
Shortly after his arrival some of those around him, wishing
to curry favour, laid before him a list of all those who had
attacked the palace, and tried to convince him that these
should not go unpunished, if only for the sake of his own
position and dignity. After long consideration the governor
at last decided to issue an edict, announcing that he had been
sent to Cyprus for the preservation of order, and that any
attempt to disturb the same would be punished by the loss of
the offenders’ heads, and that in consideration of past events
he must demand a poll-tax of fourteen piastres from all
Turks and Greeks, old men, women, and children being
excepted. After payment of this fine all was to be forgotten
and forgiven.</p>

<p>The Greeks were delighted to be let off so easily, but the
Turks laid their heads together and asked each other by what
right the new governor interfered with what had occurred
before his time. Izil Osman Aga had been declared an
offender against the law and the Sultan, and in executing
him they had only acted as protectors of law and justice.
They therefore replied to the demand that they had only
acted as faithful servants of the Sultan in revenging themselves
upon his enemies, whilst the governor on his side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
responded that his dignity would not permit of his withdrawing
the edict.</p>

<p>On this some hundreds of the malcontents assembled in
the village of Kytherea and took possession of the mill
at which corn was ground daily for all the inhabitants of
Nikosia. They also cut off the water supply to the city.
The greatest consternation prevailed, and the prudent
governor thought it best to send a deputy to Kytherea to
offer to withdraw the fine. This wise act was fully appreciated
by the people, and order and peace were once more
restored. The governor, however, felt deeply the contempt
shown for his authority, and at once set himself seriously to
bring some of the higher officials to his way of thinking. He
laid in a good store of weapons and powder, and then
considering himself strong enough to maintain his authority,
again issued the edict.</p>

<p>The men of the city were less inclined than before to
submit. On this occasion they chose as their rallying point
the famous fortress, on the coast, called Keryneia, five leagues
north of Nikosia. This castle was inhabited by a rich and
respected noble named Halil Aga, who was as ambitious as
he was resolute. His castle was soon bristling with arms
and occupied by 2000 men, who at once announced to the
governor that they purposed to do battle with him, to decide
the question of the fourteen piastres. Some days later they
again cut off the mill at Kytherea from the use of the
city, and appeared before the walls of the capital. Hafiz<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Mahommed Effendi thought it best to strike a decisive blow
without further delay. He therefore fell upon the attacking
party, but met with a severe and bloody repulse. The rebels
followed him up and endeavoured to storm the town. The
walls and defences, however, proved too strong for them, and
Halil Aga therefore decided to blockade the city and summon
the whole island to his assistance. People flocked to him
from all parts, and such as refused to join him were treated
as enemies of their country, and their houses burnt about
their ears. Whole villages were set in flames. The unfortunate
governor of Nikosia was at his wit’s end, for the
citizens were suffering severely from famine. For the second
time he was compelled to announce that he would withdraw
his claim. The desired effect was at once obtained, and the
besiegers laid down their arms, but not before the ringleaders
had bound themselves by an oath to stand by each other in
case of future necessity.</p>

<p>Whilst these events were taking place in Cyprus the three
archbishops of Nikosia, Baffo, and Keryneia, had privately
sailed for Constantinople, laid their complaint before the
Porte, and had so far succeeded in their mission that a new
governor was to be sent out; Soliman Effendi, a very worthy
old man, was appointed for this purpose, and he, they hoped,
would prove a mere puppet in their hands. Acting under
these advisers the new governor landed at Keryneia, and sent
Halil Aga some magnificent presents, highly complimenting
him on his zeal for the public good. On this Halil Aga<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
allowed Soliman Effendi to land and proceed at once, without
any opposition, to the capital. A serious complication now
arose with the old and new governors of Cyprus, and the
former declared he would not resign until he had quelled
the insurrection. The weak but good-natured Soliman at
once agreed to this view of the case, and put himself completely
under the advice and influence of the man he ought
to have supplanted. He sent messenger after messenger to
Halil Aga with the most dazzling proposals, and assured him
that if he would come to Nikosia he should be put in command
of the cavalry. Halil Aga was, however, too wise to put his
neck in such a noose. Further steps were taken on either side;
the insurgents gradually returned to their homes, and order
was again restored. This happy state of things continued until
early in the following year, when the two governors, who
could not let the question of the fourteen piastres rest in peace,
again issued an edict commanding the immediate payment of
the sum in question. Hafiz Mahommed had now a strong
party, and many in the city would willingly have paid the fine
for the murdered governor’s death sooner than aid and abet in
fresh disturbances. The mass of the inhabitants, on the contrary,
declared that the carrying out of the edict must be prevented,
even at the risk of fresh bloodshed, and made the matter
a question of their civil and religious liberty. The governor
had his proper sources of revenue, and the Sultan his import
duties and tithes, but such a thing as a fine for the death of a
murdered person, could be claimed only by the relatives of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
the victim, and the demand, they maintained, was in direct
opposition to the Koran. In these terms the mollahs had
condemned the action of the governors, and the janissaries,
as the ancient defenders of freedom and religion, had confirmed
their judgment. An open revolt at once took place,
the citizens flew to arms and hurried to Keryneia, and in a
very short space of time Halil Aga had 5000 men mustered
under his banner. In order to obtain possession of two out
of the principal fortresses, Halil Aga suddenly appeared
before Famagusta, the famous stronghold on the opposite
side of the island, but was speedily repulsed. He now encamped
before Nikosia, and put the capital in a state of
siege, announcing that he demanded, himself, to be appointed
governor of the island. Neither Mahommed nor Soliman
would agree to the proposition, and Halil Aga then informed
them that he had private commands from the Sultan, and requested
they would visit him in his camp and hear them read.
This wily message met with no response beyond such as came
from the mouths of the defenders’ guns. Meanwhile disturbances
arose all over the island. After many attempts to
storm the capital, and many sallies on the besieging army
from within her fortifications, Halil Aga also obtained some
cannon, and at once commenced a merciless attempt to force
a passage through the walls. Distress and alarm filled the
unfortunate town. At the earnest petition of such of the
inhabitants as desired peace the English consul came over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
from Larnaka and endeavoured to mediate between the
opposing parties. Halil Aga demanded on his part that a sealed
deed should be given him, offering free pardon to all who
had fought under his banner, and that all the janissaries
and officials who had joined his flag, should be reinstated in
all their former posts. Secondly, that the people of Nikosia
should accept him as their governor if he could obtain the
approval of the Sultan. The besieged governors would only
give way as to the free pardon, so the fighting continued as
before. Meanwhile news of what was going on in the island
had reached the adjacent lands and seas, and foreign powers,
who had sufficient troops to carry out the undertaking began
to speculate as to the advisability of taking advantage of such
a tempting opportunity to appropriate the island. The Porte
could be readily appeased, it was supposed, by offers of gold,
and plentiful doses of flattery, and would not refuse to confirm
any new government in its acts. Ibrahim Bey was the
first who arrived in Cyprus, having crossed over with his men
in two small galliots, but finding his forces too weak to
attempt anything he at once retired. Directly after this,
another corsair, Dschassar Bey, appeared upon the scene with
a frigate and three small munition vessels. Having speedily
landed his men, he took possession of the castle, near the salt
works of Larnaka. Halil Aga having heard of this new
arrival marched to remonstrate with him, and his overpowering
force proved such an excellent argument that this invader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
also hurried from the field. The third adventurer was Giergil
Oghlu, the governor of Karamania, situated on the opposite
coast to Cyprus. On the 27th of June he appeared before
Famagusta with a few hundred men, who overran the
adjacent country, plundering and destroying with the utmost
brutality. Before the very gates of the fortress, they are said to
have speared seven Greeks and beheaded two Turks. Happily
on this same day Kyor Mahommed Pacha, of two tails, landed
at Larnaka with 2000 foot soldiers and 500 cavalry bearing
orders from the Sultan to restore peace. He requested the
consuls of the various European powers to meet him, and
seems to have much astonished them all by permitting
them to sit in his presence during the discussion that ensued.
Having heard a full account of the state of things, his first
step was to command Giergil Oghlu to place himself and
his troops under his standard. He then requested the
English consul to write a letter to the camp around Nikosia,
stating that the pacha commanded all to retire quietly to their
homes, promising to show justice to all, and announcing that
his mission was only intended to restore peace. On the 1st
of July, shortly after the despatch of this letter, the pacha
marched towards Nikosia with all his men and accompanied
by the Karamanian troops.</p>

<p>Terror and consternation went before him, for report had
much exaggerated the number of his followers. Deserters
streamed out of Halil Aga’s camp until only about two hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
faithful followers were left; with these he retired to his fortress
of Keryneia. This castle, which is situated on the coast, is
backed by steep rocks, with the sea in front, whilst the
country round is so plentifully supplied with flowers and
fruit as to form a veritable paradise.</p>

<p>Ample means of entertainment for the garrison were provided,
and they thought themselves prepared to make an
obstinate resistance. Should the worst come to the worst
they trusted to save themselves readily by sea, as the fortress
had an entrance which opened directly on the shore, and some
small ships were anchored in the haven. Message after message
was sent from the pacha, commanding Halil Aga to
surrender in the name of the Sultan, to which he replied that
he was defending the castle for that potentate. On the 28th
of July, Kyor Mahommed encamped about Keryneia, and at
once commenced filling up the moats and making breaches in
the walls for the purpose of mounting the latter with their
scaling ladders. The besieged knew how to use their guns,
and behaved with so much spirit, that every attack was
repulsed.</p>

<p>The troop ships of the pacha now arrived and opened fire
on the fine old fortress, trying it most severely. Behind
them were seen Dschassar Bey, with his frigate and two other
ships; and last, though not least, Ibrahim Bey and his three
little galliots. These new arrivals completely closed Keryneia
on the sea side, and rendered escape that way utterly hopeless.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
The efforts of the besieged were now prompted by despair.
The pacha was becoming uneasy at the long delay, fearing
daily that there would be a general rising against him in the
island, and had recourse to base cunning to overcome his brave
antagonist.</p>

<p>The captain of the line ships, Meleky Bey, was desired to
demand a secret interview with Halil Aga. This meeting
took place on the night of the 14th of August, on which
occasion Meleky forcibly urged that it would be advisable for
Halil Aga to come on board the ships of the line, and trust to
his friendly intervention for favourable terms. There could
be no question of safety, for was it not well known that
Turkish sailors would be hewn in pieces before they would
betray a man who had trusted to their honour? Meleky spoke
with so much apparent frankness that Halil Aga fell into
the trap, and before night he had taken shelter on one of the
ships. Next day he was handed over to the pacha, who,
however, received him kindly, and offered him a tent for his
own use.</p>

<p>As soon as this reception was known in the castle, the garrison
surrendered at discretion. The position was at once
changed. All the women were allowed to retire with bag
and baggage, but the men were declared prisoners. Halil
Aga’s officers were thrown into chains, and he himself closely
watched.</p>

<p>On the 19th instant, the unfortunate captive was brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
before the pacha, who received him kindly, and requested to
hear from his own lips who had been implicated in the rising.
This done, the pacha changed his tone, and angrily demanded
whether Halil Aga supposed that the Sultan intended that
his fortresses should be used for seditious purposes? As he
spoke, some of his minions entered, and the unhappy victim
of his treachery was strangled on the spot.</p>

<p>On the 21st of August, Giergil Oghlu and his wild crew
were desired to set sail, without having been allowed to land.
The pacha retired with his prisoners, and his myrmidons at
once spread over the island. All those who had been implicated
in the late revolts, and were still free, quitted Cyprus. Many,
however, were captured before they reached the coast. Investigations
into the recent events were set on foot in Nikosia,
and at its conclusion two hundred of the accused were
decapitated. Their heads, with that of Halil Aga, were
salted down, and sent to Constantinople, with a full account
of what had occurred in this island.</p>

<p>Kyor Mahommed was made a pacha of three tails and
governor of the pachalik of Koniah. Hafiz Mahommed had
been previously desired to leave Cyprus, and Soliman Effendi
reigned in his stead. So ended a sad page in the history of
this unlucky island, which during these three years of insurrection,
had lost the flower of her Turkish population, and
seen her castles and buildings destroyed.</p>

<p>These ruins were never rebuilt; successive misfortunes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
the insecurity of the future prospects of the island seem to
have quenched all spirit of emulation and progress in the
much-tried population, and Cyprus appeared to have finally
lost her proud place in the world’s history.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER IX<br /><br />

<small><small>THE PLAINS OF CYPRUS.</small></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Early</span> on the morning of the 25th of April, I bade adieu
to Nikosia, the capital of Cyprus—a fair city even in these
days of her ruin and decay. As I look back at her, as she
appeared to me, I always find myself comparing the image
with that of a stately and beautiful dame over whose faded
charms, faint and occasional flashes of former loveliness are
now and then visible. The day was glorious as I left the
dark city gates and stepped forth upon the bright and boundless
plains; cornfields extended to the feet of the long chain
of mountains, which glowed with deepest purple in the foreground,
and towered black and shadowy in the far distance;
whilst straight before me, from behind the dark, cloud-like
masses, peeped the snowy head of Mount Olympus. This
name “Olymp,” which is conferred in almost every Grecian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
island upon the noblest snow-capped mountains, has the
same signification as our word “Alp.”</p>

<p>I had determined to ascend the Cyprian Olympus, and to
this end had made many inquiries concerning it. Had I
desired information about some unknown and unexplored
region, the few particulars I gained could not have been more
vague and trifling. I could meet with no one who had ever
made the ascent of Troados, as the mountain is now called, or
even learn whether the monastery of Troaditissa was situated
on its summit or lay below in one of the neighbouring valleys.
The Cypriotes love their ease too well to undertake these
kind of excursions, and only ridicule what they consider such
unnecessary exertion on the part of the traveller. Our party
had not ridden more than a mile and a half before cultivation
ceased, and on all sides nothing was visible but a dry and
barren waste. On this occasion I travelled over about fifteen
leagues of country, and did not see more than two or three small
villages in the whole distance. One of these was built upon
a stream which certainly must contain water enough to irrigate
the neighbouring fields and gardens during the winter and
spring, yet all the dwellings were in ruins, and no plough had
turned the pastures for certainly ten or twenty years.</p>

<p>With his usual kindness, my good friend the pacha had sent
a zaptieh who was to accompany me throughout the island
and give an account to his master on his return. This was
a great convenience to me, as it is usual to exchange the
zaptieh at every successive district. The country was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
plentifully stocked with game; quails, partridges, and larks
rose in large quantities into the air, disturbed by our approach.
In the presence of this, my body guard, the pacha had explicitly
stated that I was at liberty to shoot where and as I
pleased, so my dragoman, who had had some experience of
sport in his leisure hours, and I were able to obtain some good
shooting on our journey. Zaptieh Hussein, my man, was a
fine fellow in his way, prompt and quick at expedient. Like
most other Turkish soldiers, his mind was rude and shallow,
but his frame strong, muscular, and enduring. Those who
understand the management of these men will find them
faithful and contented servants. In either mounting or dismounting,
when going after these birds, I had managed to
lose my tobacco pouch; this pouch and contents were a little
memento of my visit to Cavalla, on the Roumelian coast,
where the finest Turkish tobacco grows. In the East, where
the slave smokes equally with the noble, from morning till
night, to lose one’s tobacco may be regarded as a real misfortune.
My dragoman pulled a long face when he heard
what had happened, and my horse-boy informed me that he
had only a little very bad tobacco to offer me. Hussein did
not say a word, but put spurs to his horse and was out of
sight in a moment.</p>

<p>We rode on slowly for an hour before my zaptieh overtook
us, and when he reached me, he drew my pouch from his
breast pocket. When a pacha or a kaimakan has half a
dozen such men on his staff he will not fail to be obeyed in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
district. A zaptieh will ride ten leagues to secure an offender,
seize him in the midst of his own friends, fasten his prisoner
to his saddle-girths, and bring him, dead or alive, to his
master. These are the men whose obstinate and manly
spirit has so prolonged the agonies of their country in its
struggles with its enemies. Call it fanaticism if you will,
but one can but admire the courage and devotion that will
sacrifice life and property, if their rulers or religion are in
danger. On such emergencies the scanty earnings of a life
are drawn from the chest, where they have been hoarded for
years, to assist in procuring what is necessary for the strife.
Sabres and guns are girded on, and for weeks these devoted
servants of the Prophet will fight without pay and deprived of
every comfort, under the very guns of the enemies’ batteries.</p>

<p>We now rode directly for the foot of the mountain over
ground covered with short grass, stunted shrub, and dwarf
palms. Now and again we passed spots covered with a
variety of red, yellow, and blue flowers, besides many tulips
and bulbous plants. It was a glorious ride and the air
delightful, so clear that the eye was never weary of endeavouring
to penetrate farther and farther into the horizon.</p>

<p>About 11 o’clock, having never passed an inhabited dwelling,
we reached a village that lies about five miles from
Nikosia, called Akazi. I can only give its Grecian name, as,
though I found the place on the map the pacha had given
me, none of our party could read its Turkish designation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
We breakfasted in this village, and after a two hours’ rest
proceeded on our way.</p>

<p>It being Easter every one was taking advantage of the fête
to lounge or lie about in the open air, while some stood in
groups round the church where the village priest was celebrating
mass. This fête lasts four days, but the people
generally manage to make a whole week’s holiday of it, and
give up themselves to hearing masses and perfect idleness. The
population of this village looked strong and healthy, which
is the more surprising when one considers the amount of
fasting imposed upon them. Not only are there two fast days
in every ordinary week, but on all sorts of extraordinary occasions.
I am told that the number of these fast days amounts to
no less than a hundred and fifty in the course of the year! I
must here remark that this is no child’s playing at abstinence—only
bread and green stuff are permitted, not even milk or
oil may be partaken of. Wonderful indeed is it to our minds
to observe on how few meals a Greek family can subsist. Even
in the houses of tolerably well-to-do people they never cook
more than twice or three times in the week, and fish or flesh
are rare delicacies. This fact will partly explain the slight
degree in which the island is now cultivated. Fruits in great
variety and vegetables of many kinds grow wild and form
staple articles of food. It is no uncommon thing to see the
Cypriotes gathering their repast as they go along and eating
it without farther ceremony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>

<p>When we once more started on our way, the sun’s rays
beat down upon us with terrible power, and as I panted
beneath it, I could not but compare it with that monster of
the African desert, the yellow lion, prowling about with
ravening jaws “seeking whom it may devour.”</p>

<p>I had heard much of the unbearable heat of the island
during the summer season, when the air is heavy and damp,
when foliage and grass are withered up, a drop of water
scarcely to be obtained, and man and beast are panting for
a breath of fresh air. We felt the sun oppressive, but seeing
the country as we did in its pride of verdure and covered
with flowers, one could scarcely picture the spot under so
different an aspect.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER X.<br /><br />

<small><small>EVRYCHU.</small></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Towards</span> evening we came in sight of Mount Olympus.
Water, as clear as crystal, was trickling down the lower rocks
in all directions, and a delicious breeze blowing from Olympus
cooled our weary frames and raised our drooping spirits as
we lay, surveying the scene around us, upon the banks of a
rivulet, completely surrounded by oleander bushes. Thus
refreshed, we continued our way along the course of the
stream under the shade of numerous trees which became
more luxuriant and various as we advanced.</p>

<p>This delightfully wooded valley contrasted well with the
bare naked rocks above. All day I had seen the snowy crest
of Mount Olympus towering above its dark companions, and
had imagined that it could only boast a snowy cap. Now, as
it rose before us, clearly distinguishable from the rocks around,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
I found that the snowy veil extended far down its sides and
slopes. All true Alpine features are entirely wanting, and
to me there seemed something harsh and unattractive in the
bare and unbroken character of its naked rock.</p>

<p>Whilst it was still light we reached Evrychu. This, the
prettiest and most populous village in Cyprus, is situated in a
lovely valley surrounded by fruitful and luxuriant pastures,
whilst above it tower majestic groups of picturesque mountains.
Evrychu lies 1700 feet above the level of the sea, and
contains seven hundred inhabitants; amongst these, however,
not more than a hundred families pay taxes. This luxuriant
valley might readily produce enough to support ten times the
number of people now dwelling there. When we arrived,
evening service was being performed in the church, and it is
no exaggeration to say that the whole of the inhabitants were
around its walls, from the youngest child to the most infirm
of its old men and women. This open-air gathering had a
fine and solemn effect. The people themselves appeared to
me to differ in many respects from the short, stout inhabitants of
the coast and plains, who look as though heat and perspiration
had baked the dust and dirt into their skins. The people of
Evrychu, on the contrary, are well grown and finely made,
and their complexions fresh and blooming. Amongst the
women and girls I noticed a great number of pretty faces.
There can be no doubt as to the fact that these people are
descended from the old Greek settlers, whilst those in the
open country and on the sea coast are descended from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
mixed race of Italians, Syrians, and Negroes. In the more
frequented parts of the island, traces of successive races were
rapidly swept away, whilst here in the mountain valley the
people have for generations lived comparatively unchanged
and undisturbed. My opinions concerning the descent of the
people were strengthened by further observations, and all
along the mountain range I noticed a strong likeness to the
Greeks of several islands in the Archipelago; the type,
however, not being quite so pure (no doubt owing to intermarriage),
nor faces and figures quite so beautiful and
slender. As for manners, well would it be if our awkward
English race could imitate the grace with which these
villagers performed the most ordinary act. When we arrived
amongst them the appearance of such an unexpected party
might have been supposed to have created quite a sensation.
Nothing of the kind occurred, the men and women were
grouped about, and evidently eyed us with much curiosity,
but no movement betrayed their feelings or ruffled their
respectful politeness. The girls stood at some distance and
observed us as closely, but with graceful dignity. Such
natural propriety of behaviour is very striking in this population,
and seems to leave the impression on the mind, of their
having, as we say, “seen better days.” Their peculiar
customs are numerous and interesting; no sooner is a guest
lodged than a woman or girl appears and offers him an apple,
with the most winning grace; this is intended as a hospitable
welcome. If you are given any kind of solid food a napkin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
is placed over your knees. A glass of water is presented to
you on the open palm of the hand, and is always accompanied
by a good wish, the giver remaining standing until
the glass is returned, when another wish is expressed that
the water may do you good. When you are about to leave,
women and girls appear and throw the leaves of the olive and
other fragrant plants into the fire. The parting guest is
expected to go through the form of smelling these leaves, in
token of his bearing away in his mind a sweet impression of
the kindness he has received.</p>

<p>Who could compare our parting act of raising the hat, with
the picturesque obeisance of these villagers, as they laid their
hands upon their hearts and gracefully inclined their bodies
towards us as they wished us farewell.</p>

<p>Whilst I reposed, my indefatigable zaptieh had been exploring
the village and inquiring for its principal inhabitant,
for the purpose of securing lodgings for me at his house.
This man, who proved to be a well-to-do peasant, soon appeared,
accompanied by his sons-in-law, and offered to escort
me to his home. The domicile consisted of three small, one-storied
buildings lying close together and standing in a small
court surrounded by stabling and sheds. The principal attractions
of this dwelling were its strong walls and watertight roof,
recommendations possessed by very few other houses in the
village, these latter being generally mere flat-roofed huts, with
walls formed of clay and interlaced branches. The accommodation
for the cattle is, of course, equally rude and simple;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
everything about these dwellings is poor except in one respect,
namely, their house linen. The excellent order in which this
is always kept, speaks highly for the industry, housewifery,
and skill of the women.</p>

<p>The landlord’s four daughters offered me a hearty reception,
and made it evident by their sparkling eyes and their
delighted manner, that they felt all the pleasure and dignity
of hospitality. Everything the place could offer was at our disposal,
and they seemed as if they could not do enough to make
us comfortable. Various members of the family appeared
in turn, in order to be introduced to me, and all, even the
children, conducted themselves with the most unembarrassed
courtesy. The sons-in-law of my host and a young relative,
who was the village schoolmaster, sat down to table with the
head of the family and myself, whilst the daughters waited
upon us. Luckily for me I had chanced upon them just at
Easter time, so we were allowed to partake of meat. The
table was ornamented with a great variety of coloured Easter
eggs, and after dinner the “egg-touching” ceremony began,
each person offering the small end of an egg to his neighbour,
saying as he did so, “Christ is risen.” This appeared to be
a favourite amusement with the children, and many eggs
were broken by their little hands. I was delighted with the
charming manner in which the youngsters grouped together,
and after the repast was over sang us an Easter hymn.</p>

<p>I cannot refrain from giving my readers the very Grecian
names of my kind entertainers. My host was called Gavril,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
one of the sons-in-law was Kleobulas Christophagu Gavrilidis,
and the other Socrates. The schoolmaster was Michel
Ivanidas, and the four daughters respectively Minerva, Terpsichore,
Penelope, and Zoisa; another maiden present was
called Evanthia. How can we account for such classic
names, if I am not correct in asserting that these people are
the direct descendants of the early Greeks?</p>

<p>Next morning I was astir at about four o’clock, and
walked out into the fresh and balmy air. A gentle wind
was wandering about the mountains, stirring the waving
foliage of the trees, and rippling the bright water of the
streams as it passed. Thrushes and nightingales poured forth
their sweetest melody on all sides, and a delicious perfume
was wafted around from innumerable flowers, and the hedges
of myrtle by which the fields are surrounded. Only one
thing was wanting to the scene—where was the rustling
sound of trees on the declivities of the mountains? As I
looked up, the first glance told me the soil was in the highest
degree fitted for their culture, and yet the eye could only discover
a variety of shrubs and mountain plants interspersed
with a few blackened stumps.</p>

<p>When I returned to the village I found the whole population
again at their devotions. In the Eastern Church the
worshippers do not attend to hear sermons and pour out their
own prayers and thanksgivings; it would appear as though
even the most earnest worshippers considered that their mere
presence and genuflections during the masses said and sung by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
their priest, was all that could be required of them. For
more than a thousand years, no change whatever has taken
place in the creed and liturgy of the Christian Church in the
East, and it may, therefore, be regarded as more closely allied
to the Primitive Church than is the Catholic Church of
Rome. With the exception of its bishops, Cyprus has no
active and learned priesthood, and nothing can be simpler
than the life and theology of its country curés. Books they
have none, and for their livelihood have to depend upon
the bounty of their flocks. Under British rule new life will
be given to the Christian Church in Cyprus, and to the
education and training of her people.</p>

<p>When we left Evrychu, our host and his sons-in-law, as is
the custom here, accompanied us to the extremity of the
village, when they took their leave.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span></p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER XI<br /><br />

<small><small>MOUNT OLYMPUS.</small></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> now pursued our way towards Olympus. At every
stage fresh beauties met our view, and every object was
smiling with the first fresh loveliness of spring. Oaks,
plantains, olives, vines, myrtles, and laurels grew in rich
profusion on the banks of the stream along which the road
lay; whilst here and there we caught glimpses of sloping
banks entirely covered with white lilies. Before us towered
steeps and broken rocks, upon which a few scattered pines
were to be seen.</p>

<p>Gradually we began to ascend a mountain pass, which was
too rough and dangerous to admit of our riding. My dragoman
therefore took the three horses, and, fastening them
together, led them along. We had not gone far before we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
lost our way. My zaptieh at once began to reconnoitre,
whilst the dragoman gave us a good specimen of his Italian
origin and French manners by uttering cries of grief and
distress, coupled with prayers for his wife and family,
and fervent maledictions on his own folly in accompanying
me; his misery was so intense that I could scarcely refrain
from laughing in his face. Had we not been obliged to help
our horses along, we should not have had any serious difficulty,
as our way, though rugged and steep, was not more so than
on many other mountain passes I had successfully climbed.
A few strenuous efforts and a little cautious steering at last
brought us to a safe footing, and we could look aloft at the
fine scene that towered above us.</p>

<p>An hour’s riding brought us within view of a broad extent
of glacier, whilst on one side the brown and purple mountain
extended to the sea, beyond which again the Cilician range
of Taurus was distinctly visible, looking like snow-covered
bastions extending along the opposite shore. The whole
scene was one never to be forgotten, and this ascent of
Mount Olympus will ever be regarded by me as one of the
most richly-rewarded experiences of my travels.</p>

<p>I had been led to imagine that this famous mountain was
still thickly wooded, but such is not the case; only here and
there we came upon a group of trees standing far apart. The
sides and peaks of the mountain, exhibited a considerable
growth of stunted shrubs, with an occasional fir-tree or broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
stump. Flowers there were in abundance, and whole tracts
were covered with hyacinths and narcissus. Not a man or a
beast was to be seen either on the mountain or in the valleys
beneath: it would have been easy to believe that some
destroying army had devastated the mountain, and then
passed on its victorious path, leaving the spot to barrenness
and desolation.</p>

<p>As we approached the summit of this famous mountain, I
observed that the trees became more numerous. On our
right the path led directly to the cloister of Troaditissa, and
on our left lay a valley extending to the foot of Olympus.
Hussein informed me that the cloister was about two leagues
distant, whilst, if I were desirous of reaching the crest, we
might do it in about three hours’ time. My dragoman no
sooner heard this latter suggestion, than he poured forth a
volley of assurances as to the folly of the attempt, and drew
a vivid picture of the various dangers that would beset our
path, winding up by informing me that many travellers had
already lost their lives in attempting this ascent. Night
would be coming on, and then what would our position be?
Why not go direct to the cloister where we could refresh ourselves,
and after a good night’s rest make the attempt in the
morning?</p>

<p>I informed my hero that it was now only two o’clock in the
afternoon, and that I had neither the wish nor the time to
retrace my steps next day; to this I added a strong appeal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
to his vanity, urging upon him the honour it would be to him
and his house for ever, if by his skilful guidance I was enabled
to reach the top. He wavered for a moment, but fear got the
better of him, and whilst I was sending on the servant and
horses to Troaditissa, he started off upon the road, shouting
back to me that “there was nothing in his agreement about
ascending such a mountain as that.”</p>

<p>I was not sorry to get rid of the cowardly rascal, and contented
myself with desiring him to wait for me at the cloister.
Hussein and I at once started to make the final ascent, and
succeeded in riding safely over the rocks and stones until we
began to reach the snow. At this point my horse refused to
stir, apparently terrified by the blinding glare of the snow.
Blows and persuasion alike failing to move him, I was compelled
to leave Hussein behind in charge of him, and continue
my way alone. It is probably many years since any one,
except myself, has made the attempt. If Mount Olympus
were on the European continent, hundreds would climb to its
summit in the course of the year; but the Cvpriotes are
indolent, and all strangers visiting the island, feel the influence
of its climate, and become disinclined for active exertion
before the end of six months.</p>

<p>The snow, which, unluckily for me, was thawing, formed
frequent streams of water, which rendered my footing so insecure
that I sank many times up to my knees. The higher
portion of the ascent was worst of all; again and again, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
hard climbing, I found myself slipping back, some twenty
paces at a time. The rocks became steeper, and the snow
being lightly frozen over, and very slippery, my only chance
was by patiently persevering and slowly mounting step by
step, digging my stick deep, and planting my feet firmly, as I
passed from one spot to another, all the time following a zigzag
direction, and experiencing all those various sensations of
hope and despair, inseparable from this kind of exertion.
Alpine travellers alone can appreciate the enthusiasm that
filled my heart, as I inhaled deep draughts of ozone and gazed
upon the scene beneath me. The landscape was one of the
grandest upon earth, and quite peculiar in its characteristics.</p>

<p>Cyprus, the third largest island in the Mediterranean,
looked from this point of view like a green and lovely gem,
washed by the blue waves of the surrounding sea, which
met the horizon on every side. Towards the north-east the
dazzling range of Taurus is distinctly visible, extending along
the Cilician coast towards Kurdistan, and opposite on the
south-east the dark purple heights of Lebanon. Upon the
summit of Olympus one stands high above every other object
in the island, and looks down upon miles of varied and enchanting
country.</p>

<p>The peculiarity of this landscape, is the strong contrast
offered by its principal features: the blue sea, the snowy
mountains, and the island itself; whilst the latter again presents
three distinct features, the dark mountains covering the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
western half of the country, the long chain of hills traversing
the Carpasian peninsula, and between these the brown and
golden tinted plains. Only once in my life could I hope to
gaze upon a scene of such magnificent beauty. The highest
point of the mountain which was entirely free from snow, is
divided into three peaks closely resembling each other in
appearance. The centre one of these, according to my own
measurement, was 6160 feet (instead of 7000 feet) above
the level of the sea. Unger makes this peak only 5897 feet
high, according to the map contained in his work on Cyprus.
It is true I had only my little aneroid to go by, but it has
never to my knowledge failed me yet.</p>

<p>In vain I searched in all directions for any trace of ancient
ruins; I found nothing save upheaved stones, and rubbish.
I do not hesitate to assure my readers that as I stood at that
immense height above the surrounding scenery, entirely cut
off as it seemed from every living creature, an indescribable
dread, that was almost fear, crept over me. Not even a bird
disturbed the air; and beneath me, as far as the eye could
reach, not a sign of animation was to be seen. On some of
the neighbouring hills I could fancy I saw small villages;
but what appeared to be houses, were probably only rocks.
The sun began to set, and a chilly breeze warned me that I
had better descend. I had not gone far before I saw Hussein
waiting below with the horses. I waved my hat to attract
his attention as I observed him looking upwards, but strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
as were his eyes, he could not distinguish me at such an
elevation even in that clear atmosphere. Our way to
Troaditissa proved much farther than we expected, and night
had long closed in before we reached our destination.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER XII<br /><br />
<small><small>CYPRUS IN ANCIENT TIMES.</small></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> we journeyed, in twilight and solitude around the mountain,
and darkness gradually approached, I could not forget
that even, to the highest peak of this very Olympus, at least
6000 feet above the level of the sea, festive bands of worshippers
had in bygone times ascended, when visiting this
sacred ground. Nothing, however, either of temple or worship
remained. The very remembrance of them was blotted out,
and even the name of the mountain is almost unknown to the
present population. The changing fortunes of the country
next presented themselves to my imagination. Already ten
dynasties have ruled in Cyprus—first the Phœnicians, then
the Greeks, to these succeeded the Persians, the Egyptian,
the Roman and the Byzantine ages, next come the Arabian,
the Frankish, and the Venetian rulers, and lastly, for nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
three hundred years, the whole country has been subject to
the rule of the Turk; the worst period of its history. The
earliest condition of Cyprus is involved in misty obscurity. On
blowing away these clouds a little, we see a large well-wooded
country altogether covered with waving trees. A large town
next becomes apparent, situated upon the southern coast, and
out of its haven, numerous small long-prowed ships are putting
to sea, manned by a bold crew, who with oars and snowy sails
are gradually making their way across the distant sea. The
sailors are Phœnicians, the large town is called Kiti, and we
descry, moreover, the abodes of numerous settlers upon the
island’s southern shore. Kiti, according to the Bible, was
founded by a grandson of Japhet—such is the venerable
antiquity which surrounded the first history of the country.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Syria next appeared upon the scene,
coming over from the opposite mainland, to cultivate these
delightful plains, to cut down their luxuriant woods, wherewith
to build ships, and to obtain from the earth the metallic
treasures there hidden. The mines were worked by the
Korybantes and the Daktyles, between whom apparently a
trade partnership or family connexion existed.</p>

<p>The industry of the inhabitants of Cyprus, even at that
early period, attained such celebrity, that Semiramis obtained
shipbuilders from Kiti to be employed on the banks of the
Euphrates. With the Phœnicians, the worship of the Syrian
goddess, Astarte, was introduced into Cyprus, to whom altars
were erected at Paphos, Amathus, and Idalion. How beau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>tiful
must then have been the forests reflected in the waters,
the verdure of the plains, the rich colour of the blossoms,
soon however to be invaded by the scorching heat of summer,
whereby the last leaf, the last blade of grass would be dried
up, not inaptly symbolising the new divinity, the teeming
but merciless goddess Astarte. Cyprus became her most
celebrated sanctuary, and the worship of Astarte, which was
imported from the banks of the Euphrates, the Tigris, and
the Nile, into Phœnicia and Cyprus, there took root, and
put forth new branches, making its way towards the north-west,
and at last reached the Greeks, a lively, imaginative,
and energetic people, who readily embraced the new religion.
After this came the Trojan War, the history of which
never will be obliterated from the memory of mankind. All
the noble warriors and chiefs who took part in the strife
with their ancestry, descendants, and personal prowess, are
freshly remembered even in the traditions of the present day,
but the chief thing to be recollected is, that this memorable
strife was the commencement of the struggle between the
East and the West.</p>

<p>At length the princely city of Troy was overpowered. A
long and bloody strife was fought out before her walls, and
upon her whitened plains are still assembled the shades of
her heroes, while their fame is emblazoned in the most beautiful
of heroic poems. Soon after the Trojan War, the Greeks
took possession of Cyprus under the leadership of Teucer,
Akamas, Demophon, Agapenor and Kephas, Praxander, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
numerous other petty chieftains, seized upon the quiet bays,
wherever the scenery of the coast had a tempting appearance,
and speedily brought their armed ships to land. They then
plunged into the dense forests, hewed down the trees, and
building entrenchments, awaited armed with shield and spear,
to see whether the islanders who were assembled in the
distance, dared to attack them. All round the coast similar
inroads were continually repeated, until at length, they ventured
up the rivers and there established their domiciles; the
nucleus of a petty state. The Greeks occupied Cyprus for a
considerable period, and mixed with the Syrians of Phœnician
or of Jewish extraction, until at length becoming assimilated
both in speech and manners, they formed but one people.
Certain inscriptions found in the country were at first quite
impossible to decipher, insomuch that they were thought
to belong to some very ancient people older even than the
Phœnicians; these have however been proved quite recently
to be of Græco-Cyprian origin.</p>

<p>Under the magic touch of Grecian refinement, the goddess
of luxury and wantonness, Astarte, became the most beautiful
of ideal creations, the mother of the Graces, the charming
Aphrodite. In the imagination of the times, Cyprus appeared
rising above the blue waves, and tinted with roseate hues.
There dwelt the glorious goddess in the midst of blooming
gardens, and shaded by the green foliage of the woods, under
the shadows of which, her worshippers were supposed to dwell
in happiness, ennobled by religious fervour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<p>This enervating period past, we find Cyprus divided into
nine petty kingdoms, whose capitals were the cities Kition,
Salamis, Amathunt, Kurion, New Paphos, Kerynia, Lapithos,
Soli, and Chytros. Numerous rivers and brooks, streaming
down from the wood-crowned hills, and enlarging as they
descended, everywhere distributed life and fertility. At the
mouth of each river or stream was a town or cultivated
district, industry seemed to have reached its highest point, and
out of thirty havens, ships went forth to earn a reputation,
which made the island dreaded throughout the Eastern
seas. Meanwhile in those continents, between which Cyprus
is situated, great empires had been established. The Assyrian,
Egyptian, and Persian, each cast covetous eyes upon
the Cyprian shores, and obstinate battles were fought for
their possession in the sixth century, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> Partly owing
to the persistent attacks from without, partly from internal
dissensions, the inhabitants succumbed and submitted voluntarily
to the rule of the Egyptians.</p>

<p>When, however, in the course of years, the Egyptian yoke
became too oppressive, and the name of Cyrus outshone all
others, the Cyprians appealed to him for assistance. No
fewer than a hundred and fifty large Cyprian galleys assisted
Xerxes in his passage over the Hellespont. Not long afterwards
Cyprus took part in the great national war against
Persia. The Greeks spared no money to defend the island
on account of its mineral wealth, and the rich supply of
wood which it afforded, wherewith to build their ships;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
also for its rich harvests of fruit and its manufactured wares,
but principally on account of its excellent position, in case
of war, with the nations inhabiting the Asiatic shores.</p>

<p>Great battles were fought in Cyprian waters, by fleets under
the command of Kimon and Enagoras, the latter of whom
had expelled the Persians from all the cities of the coast, and
assisted Cyprus in a ten years’ war against the whole strength
of Persia; a glorious example, which did not fail to make a
deep impression, throughout the whole of Greece. At length,
however, the Persians once more got the upper hand, and a
courtesan in Persepolis was enabled to squander in a single
night, the entire revenue derived from the tribute of nine
Cyprian kings.</p>

<p>Next the great Macedonian conqueror appeared upon
the world’s stage. Had it not been for his powerful and
crafty father, Philip, the union of the Greeks would never
have been accomplished; they had negotiated and fought, and
fought and negotiated, but were never ready to act in
concert, but now the strength of Macedon had united their
forces under the conduct of Philip’s heroic son, and set out
upon their great campaign in Asia.</p>

<p>When Alexander laid siege to Tyre, the Cyprian kings, of
their own accord, sent to him their powerful fleets and warlike
engines, and strove, amongst themselves, who should
most richly contribute to the festive games with which they
celebrated the news of his victories. Some accompanied
him even as far as the Indus, where the Cyprian shipwrights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
had built the fleet, in which he intended to ascend that
mighty river. The great conqueror himself, was presented with
a dagger, made by the artisans of Kiti, that was regarded
with admiration on account of its keen edge and masterly
workmanship. When the chief officers of Alexander’s army,
from being generals were exalted into kings; bloody battles
were again fought for the possession of Cyprus. Whoever
possessed this island, could command the shores of Asia!
whoever possessed the shores of Asia, but not the island, was
always open to attack! Ultimately, however, it became the
property of the Ptolemies, and remained for two hundred
years under the dominion of Egypt. Heavily was the hand
of Egypt laid upon poor Cyprus; the taxes imposed upon
its cities and villages were grievous to be borne; its nine
kings dwindled into mere shadows, an Egyptian governor
resided at Salamis, and lorded it over the land like an independent
monarch. But now the Western continent for
the third time prepared a great expedition against the East.</p>

<p>Already in Italy the heavy tread of Roman cohorts resounded,
and wherever they were heard the wreaths that
ornamented Greek or Asiatic palaces trembled, or fell, withered
to the ground. Not a word was heard of right, or wrong,
either towards the prince, or people; Egypt was taken possession
of, and Cyprus became the province of a Roman
proconsul, who established his residence in Paphos.</p>

<p>The Roman system of government in a subdued territory
differed but little from that of the Turks. Unlike the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
Turks, however, the Romans recompensed their subjects
with higher political culture, with substantial rights as
citizens, with domestic peace, with excellent roads and
harbours, with free trade throughout all their vast empire,
and—what the Turks do not vouchsafe, and in spite of all
their promises and experimental trials, only in a very limited
degree can offer to their subjects—every inhabitant of
Cyprus under the dominion of Rome, gifted with industry
and genius, had the opportunity of raising himself even to the
highest offices in the State. Throughout all the earlier
periods of its history, this island was the place where important
business, both in connexion with its mines and
agricultural produce, was carried on. It was the abode of
luxury and voluptuous enjoyment, and deeply as the Romans
helped themselves from the pockets of the Cyprians, there
was always much remaining.</p>

<p>At the end of the Roman epoch a remarkable change took
place. It has long been a recognised fact, though dismal
enough, that the instincts of sensuality, cruelty, and mystical
superstition, are entwined together as if they grew from the
same root. In Cyprus this law of nature seems to have
asserted itself throughout the land. In presence of the
mysteries of Astarte, in which abominable lust, bloodshed,
and depravity reigned triumphant, we gladly shut our eyes.
But, behold, at the magic touch of Grecian art, the gloomy
Astarte becomes transformed into the fair goddess, that rising
from the sea foam, assumes the beauteous shape of Venus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
The lovely Aphrodite, whose worship, however, still retained
enough and more than enough of the ancient rites. And
now she undergoes a third transformation. How at the
present day do the Cyprians name the Mother of God, simply
“Aphroditissa.” She is often represented in the oldest pictures,
with her dark features veiled and glittering with gold
and silver; exactly as in ancient time, the great black meteoric
stone—the idol of Venus—Astarte, was solemnly veiled
by her priestesses.</p>

<p>From the very ground, upon which formerly stood the
temple of the Cyprian Venus, little images of the Madonna
are frequently dug up, as, for example, the five goddesses,
sitting upon throne-like seats, each with a child upon its
bosom, obtained from the excavations at Idalion, and now
preserved in the Ambrose collection at Vienna. Here,
indeed, the figures are altogether of an antique character,
nevertheless, every one of the five has so completely
the characters of a Christian Madonna, that the
observer involuntarily thinks them counterfeits. The conversion
of the Aphrodite into the “Aphroditissa” occurred
during the earliest days of Christianity, when the sensual
culture of Venus gave place to the pure worship of the Virgin
Mother. The Jews meanwhile, long groaning under the
weight of Roman taxation in Cyprus, as in Palestine, and
overwhelmed with rage and despair, conspired together, and
collecting into a formidable army slew, as it is stated, 250,000
men, a number which indicates how densely populated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
island must have been. Since this fearful slaughter no Jew
has ventured to reside in Cyprus. Christianity now made
such rapid progress, that the country was divided into no
less than thirty bishoprics. The island became a land of
saints; Barrabas, Lazarus, Heraclides, Hilarion, Spiridion,
Epiphanes, Johannes, Lampadista, Johannes the Almoner,
Catherine, Acona, Maura, and a long list of holy persons
stand in the calender as belonging to Cyprus.</p>

<p>After the Roman epoch ensued the long and tedious
uniformity of Byzantine rule. The management of the
island of Cyprus, was for the most part entrusted to
the care of military and civil governors, although, sometimes,
both these functions were united in the hands of a
satrap, who bore the title of duke or kaimacan (one set above
all). The supreme governor next endeavoured to make the
succession hereditary in his own family, and for a time succeeded—a
result which soon tempted him to aim at complete
independence; for, relying on his position, and the extent of
his internal resources, he deemed the island strong enough to
defend itself. His independence, however, only lasted until
the imperial forces could be got together.</p>

<p>A fleet from Constantinople soon arrived, which, putting
on shore a sufficient number of troops, overthrew all his
schemes and punished his temerity. In the fourth century,
during which Cyprus was sinking slowly, but surely, into
political and domestic ruin, great misfortunes fell upon her.
Earthquakes destroyed her towns, and repeated droughts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
almost completed her destruction; it is said that no rain
fell during thirty years, when, as the few surviving inhabitants
were endeavouring to escape from the death-stricken
country, there appeared among them the holy St.
Helena, who carried with her wherever she went, refreshing
showers; after which the towns and cloisters were once more
filled by the returning inhabitants.</p>

<p>From the middle of the seventh to the middle of the tenth
century, the hand of man caused fearful devastation. Hordes
of pirates appeared upon the coast, who, landing at every
available place, set fire to the towns and villages, and when
the inhabitants fled to save themselves, laid hands on every
thing within their reach. Money and fruit, men and cattle,
all were hurried on board their ships. Swiftly as they had
come they departed; in vain the fleet sent out by Government
endeavoured to follow them.</p>

<p>Among the islands and havens of the Grecian Archipelago,
concealment and shelter were easily obtained; the only resource
was to place watchmen upon commanding points of
the coast, from whence they could see to a distance; and to
build towers and beacons, whence signals could be made by
means of fires and smoke, so soon as any suspicious craft made
its appearance. On seeing this signal, all the inhabitants
of the coast fled into the interior, taking their children and
cattle and their money and valuables, with them; and there they
remained concealed, until another signal from the watchman
told them that the coast was clear. Next came robbers of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
still worse description; the former only sought for what could
be readily carried off in their ships: these others were land
robbers. The pirates only struck down or burned whatever
hindered them in their proceedings; the others destroyed
for destruction sake, and collecting men like sheep drove
them into slavery. These were Arabs; from their sandy and
rocky deserts they brought with them a savage hatred against
all religious edifices, which they levelled with the ground. It
was now that the ancient buildings of Cyprus suffered: the
old temples were reduced to ruins, the towns were destroyed,
and everything Greek or Roman, perished. The Arabs
wished to establish their new Government in the island, and
for this purpose they only required bare ground.</p>

<p>In Constantinople every endeavour was made once more to
seize upon and maintain possession of the rich island. In
despair a command was issued by the Sultan, that all these
fierce intruders should leave Cyprus. The howl of the
Arab was no longer heard in the country, and the population
began again to gather itself together, first in the plains
and towns upon the coast, and afterwards little by little, the
hills became once more peopled. To this Arab period, succeeded
a respite, during which the island was enabled in
some degree to recover itself.</p>

<p>The rule of the Byzantine continued, however, for two
hundred years. Frequently did the Cyprians endeavour to
free themselves from bonds which pinioned the arms of
industry, but all in vain; the island seemed to have settled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
down into that slow decay, which was the fate of all the
Byzantine provinces. When we reflect what a system of
robbery was practised throughout the western Roman empire,
and the absolute poverty of the eastern states, and consider
that the Grecian people for thirteen centuries had to submit
to such rulers; that, in that time so many insurrections
broke out among the German, Slav, Arabian, and Turanian
nations; we must perforce recognise the excellent
material of which they are composed. It is a wonder that
after so many centuries of oppression, spoliation, and misery,
so many of them survive.</p>

<p>We have now arrived at the end of the twelfth century,
and for the fourth time the Western Continent is
assembled to do battle against the East. France and Germany
take the lead in the crusade, Italy and England assist.
For nearly a century the coast of Asia opposite to Cyprus,
from Cilicia to Egypt, had again become Christian. The
centre of the group was the kingdom of Jerusalem. Its supporters
were the principalities of Tripoli, Edissa, and Antioch,
the dominions of Cæsarea, Beyrut, Sidon, and Tyre. Only
Cyprus remained under the Byzantine yoke. Then came
Richard Cœur de Lion, and in one wild attack he subdued the
island and departed. Cyprus once more had her own king,
and by a single stroke order and peace were restored to the
island. Baronial castles, abbeys with stately halls, and beautiful
Gothic cathedrals, sprang up in all directions. The
slopes of the hills were covered with vineyards and orchard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
and the fields were sown with corn and profitable vegetables.
Rich works, and a trade that extended all over the Mediterranean,
gave life to the whole country. Famagusta and
Limasol at once took their places as large sea-ports.</p>

<p>After having been for fifteen hundred years a mere
dependency on either Memphis, Persepolis, Alexandria, Rome,
or Constantinople, Cyprus now for three, hundred years enjoyed
the blessings of self-government, and was prosperous
and in high repute. She built a new capital city, and when
the Holy Land was abandoned became the rendezvous of the
knights, who brought with them their laws.</p>

<p>As in the days of Cymon and Enagoras, Cyprus became
the arsenal where the fleets and armies of Greece armed
themselves to invade Persia. She now shone across the blue
waters of the Mediterranean as the centre of knighthood
and chivalry, from whence the unbelievers were incessantly
attacked, and for a long time victoriously fought against,
whenever they ventured to establish themselves, upon the
coast from Smyrna to Alexandria.</p>

<p>This glorious change in the condition of Cyprus was effected,
not by the inhabitants of the island, but by the knights, monks,
and citizens who came to her from foreign countries, bringing
with them knowledge, activity, and industry.</p>

<p>When the Venetians took possession of the country, it once
more sank into its former insignificance, it became merely the
treasure chest and the granary of a foreign nation. The entire
population soon lost its chivalrous character, and gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
sank into a sloth and stupidity, from which it again never
recovered; and to add to the general misery, a fearful scourge
now visited the unhappy land. In the places left desert by
diminished cultivation, locusts multiplied to such an extent
that vegetation disappeared from the face of the ground. A
still greater misfortune was the incessant destruction of the
trees and woods; the very mountains were left bare, and, as a
natural consequence, the rivers and brooks were dried up, so
that the parched land was no longer capable of cultivation.
This state of things has now existed for nearly three hundred
years. Each successive season appears worse than that
which preceded it, the rulers more rapacious, and the climate
more unhealthy. In our day, the inhabitants seem to be
slightly roused from their apathetic slumber which is principally
owing to foreign interference. This amelioration
exists particularly in the vicinity of the sea coast, once so
rich and beautiful, now so wretched and unfortunate.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER XIII<br /><br />
<small><small>TROADITISSA.</small></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> stumbling of my horse roused me from the foregoing
reflections, on the history of the famous mountain beneath the
shadow of which we now rode. Our path lay over steep and
rugged rocks, and after a long course of scrambling, my horse
at last refused to stir from the spot on which he stood. We
dismounted in hopes of discovering his cause of alarm, and
found ourselves on the very brink of a yawning precipice.
By a vigorous effort we again found our path, and after some
hard climbing, descended into a valley through which ran a
small stream.</p>

<p>In the distance I observed lights, and felt convinced they
must proceed from the monastery we were in search of. As we
approached they turned out to be bonfires, lit to celebrate the
Easter fête, and that the supposed cloister was only a small
village. We plunged our horses into the midst of the rushing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
stream in order to gain the opposite bank, but found it far
too high. We now rode up and down the bed of the stream
shouting for assistance till we were hoarse, but all was useless.
Almost in hopeless despair, Hussein made one more vigorous
effort to rouse the indolent inhabitants, and shouted at the
top of his voice for some one to come with torches and show
us our way.</p>

<p>No one answered, and we sought in vain for some means
of reaching the bank. At last, as a final effort, Hussein
gathered himself together and once more exerted his powerful
voice. This time the shout was a menace. In the name
of the pacha, he commanded the villagers to appear and conduct
a noble stranger to the cloister of Troaditissa, under the
penalty of having their houses pulled about their ears should
they refuse to comply. This had the desired effect; two men
immediately appeared bearing torches and led us on our way.
From them we learnt that a foreign gentleman who spoke
good Greek, had called at the village about two hours previously
with his servant, and had requested to have a guide to
the cloister; this could have been no other than my courageous
dragoman, and I pictured to myself his anguish when he
found himself lost and belated.</p>

<p>When our guides heard I had ascended to the summit of
Olympus they assured me I might consider myself lucky to
have escaped any attack from the demons and kobolds who
haunted the spot. Had I not heard, they inquired, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
temple of Aphroditissa had been removed lower down because
of the machinations of these evil ones?</p>

<p>The village of Fini, which we now left, lay about 1000 feet
below the monastery, and was separated therefrom by a steep
and rocky road. My whole frame was exhausted, and had I
had any idea of the distance we must still traverse before
reaching our destination, I should certainly have insisted on
remaining for the night in any one of the village huts, however
squalid it might be. As it was, I was in the hands of my
energetic zaptieh, who hurried on our guides with all possible
speed. For myself I was quite past everything, except clinging
on to my horse, to keep myself from falling, letting him
stumble on by himself, guided only by his instinct through
the pitchy darkness of the night. I thanked Heaven loudly
when about eleven o’clock we reached the gate of the cloister.
An Easter bonfire was also burning here, formed of two huge
trees, which as they slowly burnt were pushed further into
the flames in order that the fire might not die out before
sunrise.</p>

<p>I was at once conducted to my apartments, which, though
the best in the house, bore a most disgusting resemblance to a
stable; and had scarcely set my foot upon the floor, when my
dragoman’s head appeared out of his bedclothes, and he commenced
a woeful tale of sufferings and alarms. He was starving
with hunger, and the monks had only given him a piece of
wretched bread that he could scarcely put his teeth into! For
my supper, the worthy brethren brought me an earthen pot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
of the dirtiest, containing some cold turnips and a small piece of
salt beef. Hungry as I was I could not have touched them.
Luckily for us the superior of the cloisters appeared and
ordered some wine and eggs to be brought. The wine, which
was excellent, revived us, and loosened the tongues of the
two monks who bore us company, and we chatted gaily far
into the night. This capital wine (Mavro) is of a very
deep red colour, and is made in the neighbouring
village of Fini. Its effect upon my exhausted frame was
marvellous. I have often found during my journey in
Cyprus that a glass of Commanderia was the finest remedy
for over fatigue, and I quite understood the popular idea of
its being by far the best medicine in many cases of illness.</p>

<p>Early next morning I was roused by the bells, which were
hung almost directly over my head. Mass was being celebrated
in the little church; this was far too small for its
village congregation, and the men were standing outside with
lights in their hands, whilst the women kept farther in the
background. When the celebration was over, the women
and girls seated themselves upon the trunks of some trees,
and began eating the food they had brought with them,
whilst the men mounted to a rough balcony in front of the
cloister, and sat down upon some benches. The two monks
now appeared with baskets and earthen vessels, and after the
men had kissed their hands, presented each with a linen
cloth to spread over his knees, and then gave a plentiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
supply of bread, cheese, and wine. This repast was followed
by a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>Amongst the women I noticed many with truly classic
features, but in most cases they had heavy figures. Two
girls, however, were perfect types of statuesque beauty, and
would have made a sculptor’s heart leap with joy.</p>

<p>Whilst I was enjoying this scene a third old monk appeared
who was suffering terribly from a wound in his leg, which had
not been properly attended. I showed the poor old soul how
to make some lint, and lay it on the sore, thickly overspread
with tallow from the fat of a goat. This act of charity performed,
I followed the good brothers into the chapel. Like
most cloister churches in Cyprus, it appeared to date from
very ancient times, and was probably built when Christianity
first reached the island. Near this little edifice stood two
rough buildings, containing a few rude chambers which, with
the chapel, formed the whole of the monastery. Should anyone
wish to pass a week in this spot he must accustom himself
to the pangs of hunger, as the worthy monks practise the
abstinence on fast days, which they require of their flock.</p>

<p>This cloister can boast one most curious and valuable relic,
namely, a picture of the Madonna worked in silver and gold,
with the heads of mother and child painted on ivory. This
curiosity is five and a half feet long, by three and a half feet
wide. When I raised the veil that (as is usual in the island)
hung over the face of the Mother of God, I observed two
large silver plates, bearing the device of the Russian double<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
eagle, and the date 1799, from which it would appear that
this fine work had been the gift of imperial piety. This was
no doubt an act of wisdom, as the whole surrounding country
still seems pervaded by a host of superstitions dating from
heathen times. This monastery is the constant resort of
pilgrims on account of the healing powers with which this
picture is supposed to be endowed, and the poor brotherhood
are often hard pressed to find food for themselves and their
numerous visitors.</p>

<p>When we were leaving, the old monk again appeared; his
leg was much better, and he fell upon my neck and embraced
and thanked me with much gratitude. Our road lay through
the scene of our last night’s troubles, and I trembled as I saw
the pitfalls we had passed in the pitchy darkness, and yet
escaped with our lives.</p>

<p>I was now desirous of riding through the country to the
monastery of Chrysorogiatissa, which I understood to be
about seven or eight leagues distant; we found, however,
that it took us an entire day to reach the spot.</p>

<p>Shortly after leaving the village of Fini we entered a
magnificent valley, enclosed by reddish brown mountains,
with trees scattered here and there upon the declivities.
These reminded me of the trees upon the open prairies of
America, which are only met with at about every 200 or 300
feet. On the prairies, however, the trees when they do
appear, form pleasing objects in the landscape, whilst the
stunted growth upon the Cyprian mountains only gives an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
impression of barrenness and decay. We saw a few firs at
an elevation of 4000 feet, and in some of the upper peaks a
few pines are still to be met with. A very different scene
presented itself in the valley beneath us. From every stone
and rock hung long grass and clumps of flowers, and in some
places, these were entirely covered with brilliant mosses and a
variety of creeping plants. Bushes of sage, marjoram, cistus,
arbutus, laurel, and myrtle covered the ground, whilst oaks,
juniper, and mastic trees spread their roots in all directions
near the rippling waters of the stream that irrigated this
beautiful valley. The soft foliage of the tamarisk contrasted
finely with the dark branches of the pines and the silver-grey
of the wild olive.</p>

<p>On the trees and bushes were perched a host of feathered
songsters, and every cleft and fissure in the low-lying rocks
streamed and rippled with sparkling water. Every here
and there we came upon a spot where the moist swampy
earth was covered with peonies, tulips, and a variety of
bulbous plants, whilst every decaying tree stump showed a
luxuriant crop of orchids and rare creepers. The whole air
was so charged with heavy perfume from these multitudinous
flowers, that I breathed more freely when we reached a slight
eminence and were met by a refreshing breeze, which bore
with it the delicious odour of some neighbouring fig-trees.</p>

<p>In passing through one of these valleys we found the sun
intolerable. It actually seemed as if the heat were rising from
the ground and would scorch our legs. I have, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
never felt in Cyprus, except on this occasion, that overpowering
sultriness which is so often experienced in Sicily;
still, it of course must be thoroughly understood that I travelled
through the island in the freshness of early spring.</p>

<p>Let no one imagine that our path through these picturesque
valleys was without its difficulties and annoyances. Over and
over again we lost our way, and at last we were compelled to
plunge into the bed of the stream and let our horses swim and
struggle as best they could over the loose stones that beset
them at every step. When we again landed our way lay
along the edge of a steep declivity and over walls of rock,
without a trace of roadway or anything to indicate the course
we ought to take. A tedious ride at length usually brought
us to a deep gully, beyond which lay another luxuriant and
laughing valley. In this manner we journeyed all day, following
the course of the stream and the goat paths, whenever
it was possible, and stumbling on as best we might when these
were not available.</p>

<p>At noon we stopped to rest upon a hill above the murmuring
waters of the mountain stream, and for the first time that
day heard the distant sound of sheep-bells. Gradually the
tinkling became more distinct, and in a short time two
shepherds with guns on their shoulders appeared upon the
scene. They were fine fellows, and gave me many interesting
particulars of their life on the mountains, whilst gratefully
sharing the meal we were enjoying. They belonged to a
nomad race, wandering during the greatest part of the year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
about these mountains with their flocks, and sleeping in little
huts roughly made of branches for the occasion. On my
asking if many shepherds lived this life they laughed, and
assured me that not only men and boys, but women and girls
passed whole months in this manner among the mountains,
the women carrying a light spindle about with them, and
plying their wool spinning, a work they much prefer to
labouring with the hoe and sickle in the fields. Exactly
such a life as this I have often witnessed in the Greek islands
of Samothrace and Thasos, and exactly such features, build,
and dress as these men exhibited. Like their Grecian
brothers our Cyprian friends, imitated the shriek of the
vultures and the calls of a great many birds, in the most
perfect manner. I inquired of these shepherds, if they could
give me any particulars concerning the mufflons, a species of
wild goat, but could only learn that it was but very rarely
met with. From what I could gather, I imagine that it is
nearly extinct.</p>

<small><small>CYPRIAN WOODS AND FORESTS.</small></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cyprus</span>, of late years, has been gradually sinking to decay
through the supine indolence and indifference of her
degraded population. In no particular does the whole surface
of the country suffer so severely as in the utter devastation
of her mountain forests. All the former rulers of
this beautiful island, Greeks, Persians, Egyptians, Romans,
Arabs, and Byzantines gave particular attention to the
cultivation of the fine trees that contributed so largely to
her prosperity. Oaks, firs, fig-trees, and nut-trees covered
the entire island, even to the sea-shore. During the two
first centuries of the Lusignan dynasty the first formidable
attack was made upon the luxuriance of Cyprian forests,
and timber was employed in enormous quantities for the
building of merchant vessels, and the construction of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
fine fleets that Cyprus sent forth to the coasts of Asia Minor,
Syria, and Egypt.</p>

<p>Then came the Venetians, equally bent on shipbuilding,
but their prudent foresight forbade them to hew down
without planting again, and under their rule the forests
flourished almost as luxuriantly as ever. A very different
state of things arose under the improvidence and carelessness
of Turkish rule. If a hundred trunks were wanted, a thousand
were hewn down, it being easier to select the finest trees
as they lay upon the ground than when towering among their
companions. The best were taken and the rest left to rot
where they had fallen. Every maritime disaster entailed
fresh destruction to the Cyprian forests. Pachas, kaimakams,
and agas, year by year increased their revenues by
cutting down the trees, and leaving what they could not
sell, to be appropriated by whoever chose to take them. The
fine forests were under no protection from Government, and
the poorer classes drew a considerable part of their livelihood
from the sale of the trees they cut down. Mehemet
Ali, the first Viceroy of Egypt, gave the finishing stroke
to this work of folly by permitting, or rather encouraging,
any one who chose, to fell the trees and send them to Egypt
to assist in the construction of ships, water-wheels, and
canals.</p>

<p>All over the island this wanton destruction of their trees by
the Cypriotes is observable. Every village or occupied spot
is remarkable for the spoliation of its surrounding timber;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
small trees are cut down at the roots, whilst the giants of
the forest, whose huge trunks could only be overthrown by
patience and exertion, have had all their branches and bark
lopped off and hacked away.</p>

<p>Another powerful cause of destruction is to be traced to
the constant occurrence of fires in the woods and forests.
These arise principally from the carelessness of the wandering
shepherds and their families, who kindle a blaze without the
slightest attempt to avoid the destruction that so frequently
ensues. During the course of our ride I have often passed
several of these charred and blackened districts, where it was
quite evident the progress of the fire had only been arrested
by there being no more trees or shrubs to devour. When
the value of this rich source of wealth to the island is again
appreciated a very short space of time will be required before
the forests are again flourishing in all their former beauty.
The fertility of Cyprus is truly marvellous, and should a
tract of country be left unravaged for three years, trees of
every variety will again rear their heads. Even on the most
arid part of the mountains, I frequently observed a fine
growth of young firs and pines; these, however, would not
be allowed to reach maturity, for what the hand of man does
not sweep away is destroyed by the sheep and goats as they
wander unrestrained about the hills.</p>

<p>Forests of dark pines were once numerous upon the higher
ranges of mountains, but these have also fallen victims to
the recklessness of the islanders. Resin and pitch are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
marketable articles, and to obtain these the trees have
been mercilessly destroyed. Operations are commenced by
stripping off the bark on one side, the finest trees being
always selected, as high as the man can reach, and the resin
taken. Fire is then applied to the base of the trunk, and a
few hours suffice to lay it low. The branches are then
lopped off, and, with portions of the trunk, are heaped into a
roughly constructed oven formed of quarried stone. Fire is
then applied to the wood and the resin pours forth into a
little channel cut to receive it. The first-fruits of this process
is called kolophonium, and the second resin, whilst the
last result forms a kind of tar. Half the resin is, of course,
wasted in this rough process, and when the devastators have
taken of the best the hill-side affords, they climb down to
another green and luxuriant spot, there to recommence their
work of destruction. A sort of mania for this wanton mischief
seems, actually, to possess, the Cypriotes. Quarrels are
of constant occurrence between the inhabitants of different
villages and communities, and no better way to avenge themselves
occurs to the contending parties, than to burn down and
hack each others trees under the concealment of night. To
burn down a fine tree, merely for the pleasure of seeing and
hearing it crackle and blaze, is an amusement constantly
practised by the ignorant and unreflecting shepherds as they
lounge away their day upon the mountain side. I made many
attempts to open the eyes of the people to the utter folly of
such a course of action, and was generally met with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
answer that it was done by the wish of the Turkish Government.
The Cypriotes have become so accustomed to
attribute every evil of their lives to this source, that they
actually appear to consider their late rulers responsible for
their own reckless indolence.</p>

<p>In order to restore the forests of Cyprus to their pristine
luxuriance only one course can be adopted: All woods and
forests must be put under the immediate protection of
Government, and every act of wanton destruction made
punishable. The present trade in resin must be entirely put
down, or only permitted under heavy restrictions. Should
this course be pursued under British rule many districts will
rapidly prove its wisdom. Whole tracts of country, I fear,
must be entirely replanted. The land around the villages
should be allotted to the inhabitants, and boundary lines permanently
fixed. A little encouragement from their priests
and schoolmasters would induce the vain and envious
Cypriotes to vie with each other in the cultivation of their
new possessions. I had a long and interesting conversation
on this subject with the late governor of Cyprus, a most
enlightened and high-minded gentleman. His opinions on
this point were not less decided than my own as to the imperative
necessity of replanting and cultivating the Cyprian
woods and forests, if the island is ever again to rise from her
present degraded condition. If this is not done, rivers and
streamlets will year by year dwindle away, and waste ground
entirely take the place of what were once well-watered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
plains. The pacha strongly urged the desirability of
introducing the eucalyptus upon all the plains and the table
rocks before alluded to. I inquired if this was likely to
be done, but my only answer was a deep sigh.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER XV<br /><br />
<small><small>PLAGUES OF LOCUSTS.</small></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Happily</span> for this unfortunate island, the plagues of locusts
which formerly were very common, are now unknown. An
old chronicle informs us that from the year 1411 to 1413
every tree in the country was perfectly leafless. During the
last century, this terrible scourge—which came with the
north wind from the Caramanian mountains—appeared
every few years, and was principally attributable to the fact
that in the neglected state of the country, these pests of the
farmer were perfectly unmolested, and having once taken
possession of the eastern table lands, laid their eggs there
from season to season.</p>

<p>When locusts are first hatched, at the end of March, they
are no larger than spring-tails, and congregate in innumerable
myriads upon every bush and plant. A fortnight later, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
they have twice changed their skins, they are fully half a
finger long, and have already commenced their hopping and
creeping westwards, destroying every leaf as they pass. In
the next fortnight they again cast their skins twice, and have
their wings fully developed. Now commences their triumphant
progress, and the air is filled with the rushing
sound of their destructive presence. Their rapacity is simply
marvellous, fields of corn are devoured to the very roots, and
within a few minutes after their appearance, fruitful gardens
are entirely laid waste. Every edible thing is destroyed, and
it is not at all uncommon for these hideous swarms to enter
the houses and devour everything that they obtain access to.
The work of devastation ended, they fall dead in thousands
of thousands on the sea-shore and open country, filling the
air with their pestiferous breath.</p>

<p>In the present day, Cyprus is mercifully entirely free from
this overwhelming plague. This happy state of things was
brought about, partly, by the energy of the then ruling Turkish
pacha, who commanded that a certain measure of locusts
should be collected by every one for the Government and
then buried. The whole population were at once awakened
to the urgency of the case. Trees and shrubs were set on
fire whilst their devouring hosts passed over, and soldiers,
horses, and oxen were called into requisition to stamp out the
enemy. The districts where the eggs lay were ploughed, and
no stone left unturned, to render the general purification as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
complete as possible. Only money and people were wanting,
to make the attempt sufficiently general.</p>

<p>At this crisis, a large landowner, M. Mattei, residing at
Larnaka, hit upon a simple plan of ridding the country of
this annual pestilence. It had been observed that a locust
could not ascend a smooth surface. The walls of Nikosia to
a certain height were therefore made smooth and whitewashed.
Mattei had also calculated that even, when fully winged, the
creatures were compelled to seek the earth at short intervals,
and continue their way by creeping and hopping. He caused
ditches to be dug, and behind these, strips of linen and oil-cloth
were stretched in such a manner as to form low walls; or slight
partitions of planks or other smooth materials were erected.
Behind these, other ditches and similar walls were made at
given distances. The locusts came, and finding it impossible
to scale these artificial walls, fell in masses into the ditches
dug for their reception, where they were either covered with
earth, and at once destroyed, or were shovelled out, thrown
into sacks, and buried in other spots. Such as managed to
rise above the first wall, rarely got over the second, and in no
instance reached the third intrenchment. This simple method
of freeing the country of these terrible pests, which was described
to me by M. Mattei himself, was at first only tried
about Larnaka and Nikosia, but so extraordinary was the success
of this ingenious experiment that the example was shortly
followed all over the island, with the most satisfactory results.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER XVI<br /><br />
<small><small>CHRYSOROGIATISSA.</small></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> we gradually emerged into the open country, I
recognised our geographical position, and experienced fresh
astonishment at the number of fine streams, by which, if
proper justice were done to them, the island would be once
more readily fertilised. From this place we observed
numerous tributaries of the ancient Lycopotamos (River
Kurio), which flows into the sea at Episkopi (Curium), and
of the Keysoypotamos (River Diorizos), which discharges its
waters near Kuklia (Palea Paphos), and a little further on
passed the principal branch of the latter river. Every mountain
gully and valley seemed filled with the sound of rippling
water, and I could not but compare the whole range of hills,
to one huge rocky spring or reservoir.</p>

<p>At this season, the country was saturated with the late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
snows and winter rains, but in summer, doubtless, these
numerous sources rapidly dry up under the burning sun,
and the earth again becomes scorched and arid. From the
eminence upon which I stood, I could see innumerable
streamlets coursing down the sides of the mountains, which
extended their undulating brown-tinted declivities as far as
the eye could reach. In the distance, on our right hand, we
saw the monastery of Kikku (the richest and most extensive
cloister in the island, and the very stronghold of Cyprian
brotherhoods), towering like a pyramid into the air. This
monastery is four or five leagues from Troaditissa, and is
perched so high on the upper ridge of the mountains as to
be very difficult of access. This does not prevent numerous
pilgrims visiting her shrine, which possesses a very valuable
and ancient picture of the Madonna.</p>

<p>Towards evening we reached the village of Panagia, and
again found all the inhabitants assembled around their church;
on this occasion, however, old and young were enjoying a
little social intercourse. The men and women chatting and
laughing, whilst the youngsters sported around under the
shadow of the trees, and lent an animated charm to
the scene. Again I could not fail to remark that almost
every kind of fruit tree flourishes, and bears good fruit in a
wild state. Mulberries, apricots, almonds, and cherries were
here in great profusion.</p>

<p>Our arrival at the monastery of Chrysorogiatissa, which
was delayed until after dark, did not appear to please the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
worthy brothers. Monks and servants were all in bed; but
after much knocking and delay, a monk and negro appeared,
who admitted us, and brought out some bread and bony
goats’ flesh for our delectation. Next morning when I left
my hard and comfortless bed, I found that both cloister and
mountain were enveloped in a thick white mist. This monastery,
which for size ranks next to Kikku, contains fifteen
monks, and employs fifteen servants, who cultivate part of
the land belonging to the monastery, the rest is let out on
lease. All the Cyprian cloisters are richly endowed, and are
required to pay but few taxes to Government; but in spite of
this wealth, these religious houses can bear no comparison
with the abbeys of England. The church, which reminded
me of the archiepiscopal chapel at Nikosia, has a fine figure
of the Saviour, with nimbus, and right arm and hand of
silver (the latter is raised as though in the act of blessing).
Among the representations in wood carving, I noticed Eve
holding the apple, and Adam with a fine moustache.</p>

<p>As the mist disappeared I was able to observe the scene
that lay beneath me. The cloister stands back towards the
south upon the highest range, and commands a magnificent
view. This monastery was formerly called Rogio.</p>

<p>At breakfast, which was a much more appetising repast
than our supper could have led us to expect, we were
honoured by the presence of the Father-Abbot, who came
accompanied by the negro and another servant. From him
I learnt that this place had formerly been the seat of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
bishopric, until about thirty years ago, when the bishop preferred
removing his residence to the more busy town of Baffo.
This worthy priest also gave me some valuable information
concerning the present deserted state of the surrounding districts.
For seven leagues, north, south, and west, the country,
he informed me, was almost uninhabited.</p>

<p>Whilst I was chatting with the friendly abbot, my dragoman
appeared with consternation written on every feature.
The whole mountains, he assured me, were infested by robber
hordes; Michaili, my horse boy, substantiated the statement,
and both refused to leave the monastery. On inquiry I found
that three men had been making requisitions on the cloister at
Troaditissa, and after other acts of violence had been lodged
in the gaol at Nikosia. This prison, which is situated beneath
the late governor’s palace, often contains as many as a thousand
convicts, guarded by a strong force of police. In the
centre of this square, is a forlorn-looking tree, from the branches
of which many wretches have been hanged by order of the
Governor-General of Cyprus. At the present day the governor
cannot put a man to death without special orders from Constantinople;
when this order arrives a policeman is summoned,
whose duty it is to pass a rope round the victim’s neck, and,
without more ado, to drag him to the fatal tree, where he is
left hanging for several hours after life is extinct.</p>

<p>Whilst upon the subject of Cyprian prisoners, we must
not fail to lay before our readers the great severity of punishment
now being undergone by an unfortunate now in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
fortress of Famagusta. To Mrs. Cesnola, the amiable wife
of the well-known author from whom we quote, the unhappy
man was indebted for obtaining some mitigation of his
sufferings.</p>

<p>It is scarcely too much to hope that under British rule
these terrible dungeons may be investigated, and the hands
of mercy in many instances extended to their suffering
occupants.</p>

<p>“On one occasion,” writes the general, “when visiting
the armoury of the prison, the attention of the ladies of my
party was attracted to some trailing crimson flowers which
overhung a parapet. To their astonishment a short, broad-shouldered
man who had remained near them, and who
had attracted the attention of all, by his commanding figure
and fine, manly face, sprang to the parapet with the agility
of a cat, broke off some of the blossoms, and returning,
presented a spray to each of the ladies with the utmost grace.
As he did so, they observed to their horror that he was
shackled with heavy iron chains from the wrist to the ankle.”</p>

<p>His large, sad blue eyes, and hair prematurely streaked with
grey, seemed to plead in his favour, and on inquiring his
crime the general learned that he was no less a personage
than the celebrated Kattirdje Janni, the Robin Hood of the
Levant. This robber chief, it is stated, never committed a
murder, or permitted one to be perpetrated by his band. It
appears, that whilst in the service of a gentleman in Smyrna
he fell in love with his master’s daughter, with whom he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
planned an elopement, but having been betrayed, he was
overtaken and thrown into prison. From thence he escaped
into the mountains, near the ruins of Ephesus, and entered
upon the wild career which finally brought him to Famagusta.
He and his band were in the habit of lying in wait for the
parties who they knew were travelling with large sums of
money, and kindly relieving them of its charge. They also
frequently captured persons of wealth and detained them
until a ransom had been paid. Kattirdje Janni would often
give this money in alms to the poor, and we are told he presented
about one thousand young Greek girls with marriage
portions. No one ever dreamed of informing against him,
owing to a superstitious belief amongst the peasants that evil
would befall the man who did so, and all attempts of the
Government to take any of the band were long futile.</p>

<p>“At the time of the Crimean war, whilst the English army
was at Smyrna, five hundred soldiers went out, assisted by the
Turks, in order to secure him, but were entirely unsuccessful.
The following authentic incident will testify to the boldness of
this robber chief, and the terror in which he was held. One
evening, when a family near Smyrna were sitting at supper,
they were amazed at beholding twelve men armed to the teeth
enter the apartment, headed by the bold outlaw. These
uninvited guests, quietly seated themselves, remarking that
they would wait until the family had finished eating, and
then they would have some supper. When Kattirdje Janni
had finished his repast, he told his trembling host that he and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
his family were henceforth free to hunt and travel where
they liked, as he, Kattirdje Janni, never forgot a kindness.</p>

<p>“Tiring of this wild life, he gave himself up to the Turkish
authorities, on the understanding that he was to be exiled to
Cyprus, and not otherwise punished. The Turks would probably
have been merciful to him, but, unfortunately, a young
Frenchman, connected with the consulate of Smyrna, had
been very badly used by his band. On this account the
French ambassador insisted, that Kattirdje Janni should be
imprisoned and treated in the most rigorous manner. He
was immured in a dungeon, and for seven years chained like
a wild beast to the walls of his cell. He was afterwards
removed to the fortress of Famagusta, where he is still
confined.”</p>

<p>The two superiors of the monastery accompanied me to
the gates, where I found eight stalwart grey-bearded brothers
waiting to bid me farewell. I could not refrain from commenting
on their fine figures, when they laughingly assured
me, there were many more of their stamp to be found in
these mountains. Their faces were sunburnt and ruddy, and
contrasted strangely with the white robes of their order. I may
here mention that these mountaineers love their native hills
with an ardour not to be surpassed by any people in the
world. As we descended the steep face of the mountain
the whole scene was still enveloped in a thick mist. At the
bottom we saw two Turkish women tending their cows, and
looking in their white veils like a couple of substantial ghosts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
About a league and a half further on, we passed a deserted
church, which was perched upon a rock, and completely in
ruins. We also observed some sheep, with broad flat tails,
grazing on the mountain side. During the whole of this
journey to the coast I could readily have imagined I was
travelling over one of the rocky parts of Northern Germany,
whilst the scenery to the north-east, with its craggy peaks,
strongly recalled to my remembrance some parts of the
Vosges mountains. I must, however, admit that the Cyprian
scenery is decidedly finer than that of Upper Alsace. Such
human habitations as we passed were miserable in the extreme;
mere mud-roofed huts with a small aperture to admit
of ingress and egress. These structures closely resemble those
I have seen in the north parts of Samothrace, but the latter
are somewhat larger and certainly cleaner.</p>

<p>After four hours’ hard riding we at length descended into
a narrow valley which opened upon the plains beyond, and
afforded us a good view of the sea, with its yellowish green
coast. Our journey through the mountains was almost over,
and on the whole, I must confess to a feeling of disappointment,
as I looked back over all I had seen. During the last
four days the neglected state of the country and the wretched
condition of its people seemed to have thrown a veil of depression
and melancholy over every spot I visited, whilst even
the grand and imposing mountain ranges I had traversed,
would not bear comparison with those of Crete or the Canary
Islands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span></p>

<p>As we now approached the coast I saw before me the
portion of country, formerly dedicated to the worship of the
Goddess of Beauty. This tract, which is about one and a
half leagues broad, extends for three or four leagues along
the shore, and slopes gently to the sea. Directly before me
lay the small town of Ktima, whilst somewhat lower down,
nestled a small fort. On this spot formerly stood the city of
New Paphos, and on the left, about two leagues distant, the
village of Kuklia, which stands upon the site of Old Paphos.
The scenery at this spot possesses much quiet beauty. In the
rear tower the dark hills, looking down upon an extensive open
tract of fields, whilst in front spreads the sea, the waters of
which encroach upon the land in a picturesque variety of
curves and tiny bays. At this spot, the ocean-born goddess
was supposed to have been borne upon the waves to shore,
and here, upon a slight eminence, the most famous and
ancient of her numerous temples was erected. Crowds of
pilgrims and eager worshippers hurried to the spot and joined
in the excited processions that passed backwards and forwards
between Old and New Paphos.</p>

<small><small>THE TEMPLE OF VENUS.</small></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> journey terminated for the present at the house of the
Bishop of Baffo, who resides in Ktima. The bishop, who is a
young and stately man, received me with the greatest kindness
and affability. He at once conducted me to a luxurious
apartment, where we seated ourselves upon soft cushions
placed on a costly Turkey carpet, and my host resumed the
ten feet long chibouk, filled with choice tobacco, he had been
smoking when I was announced, and courteously offered another
to me. It was quite evident the worthy bishop was a
man of substance, and thoroughly enjoyed the good things of
this life. From the roof of the house I obtained a magnificent
view of the sea and neighbouring coast.</p>

<p>The Temple of Venus, formerly the great object of interest
on this coast, was situated on a small hill at a distance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
about twenty minutes’ walk from the sea. Some parts of its
colossal walls are still standing, defying time and the stone-cutter,
although badly chipped by the latter. The stones, of
which these walls are built, are most gigantic, one of them
being fifteen feet ten inches in length, by seven feet eleven
inches in width, and two feet five inches in thickness.
Strange to say, the stone was not quarried in Cyprus,
but is a kind of blue granite which must have been imported
from either Cilicia, or Egypt. This temple, as
rebuilt by Vespasian, seems to have occupied the same
area as the former one, and was surrounded by a peribolos,
or outer wall. Of this wall, a few huge blocks are now
only extant. On the west of this outer wall there was a gateway,
still plainly visible; its width was seventeen feet nine
inches: the two sockets for the pivots on which the doors
swung are of the following dimensions—length six inches,
width four and a half inches, depth three and a half inches.
The south-east wall was excavated, and its whole length
ascertained to be 690 feet. The length of the west side
was only traced as far as 272 feet, as the modern houses
of Kuklia were erected above it; the length of the other
two sides were also for the same reason not ascertained. The
walls of the temple itself, which are constructed of the same
kind of blue granite, but not in such huge blocks, were only
traced with much difficulty, and although very little is to be seen
above the surface, yet strange to say, the four corner-stones
are still standing. The north-east corner-stone forms part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
of the wall of a house in Kuklia, while the north-west corner
stone stands in a cross street of the village by itself; the
south-east corner-stone stands also by itself in an open field,
where the Christian population of Kuklia burn lamps and
little wax candles, but in honour of whom, or for what purpose,
is uncertain. The south-west corner-stone, likewise, forms
part of a modern dwelling-house.</p>

<p>The temple was oblong, and of the following dimensions:
the eastern and western walls measured 221 feet, and the
two other sides 167 feet.</p>

<p>The north-west corner-stone has a hole in it thirteen
inches in diameter, and a similar hole also exists in the
south-west corner of the outer wall. As this temple possessed
an oracle, it is more than probable that the use
of these strange holes was connected with it. If a person
stands upon one of these huge perforated stones, he can
produce a clear and fine echo of a sentence of three or
four words, if pronounced in a distinct but moderate tone
of voice.</p>

<p>Abundant indications of mosaic pavement, both in the
area of the temple and in the court-yard, exist, where can be
found, many prettily designed pieces of various colours—yellow,
white, red, rose-colour, and brown. About three
feet beneath these mosaics, were also found several large
pedestals of colossal statues, bearing Greek inscriptions, and
many other pedestals were lying about, possibly having been
left by former excavators; most of those, which Cesnola dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>covered
under the mosaics, were of the same kind of stone as
that of which the walls of the temple were built, but of a finer
grain. The inscriptions were of the Ptolemaic period, from
which it is probable that Vespasian only repaired the Temple
of Paphos, or if he rebuilt it entirely, it was with the former
stones. The foundations are only six and a half feet deep, but
upon having other borings made another foundation was
discovered beneath, but evidently of an earlier period and
very massive. Singular to say, in boring no sculptured
remains were found, and but few fragments of pottery.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Tacitus gives us the following representation of the
sacrificial rites employed in this temple.</p>

<p>“The victims to be sacrificed must be carefully selected,
males only being chosen. The safest auguries are obtained
from the entrails of goats. It is forbidden to sprinkle blood
upon the floor of the temple, and the altar must be purified
with prayer and fire. The image of the goddess is not in
human shape, but is a rounded stone tapering upwards like a
cone. Why such a shape should be adopted is not clearly
explained.” At that time, therefore, the worship of this
goddess was shrouded in mysterious secrecy. The people
only knew that it had been handed down to them from very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>ancient times. The only answer they received to their
inquiries, why it was so, being, “It is a mystery.”</p>

<p>We learn from other sources, that this cone-shaped stone,
erected in the innermost sanctuary of the temple, was black.
Upon the festivals of the great goddess the stone was carefully
washed by the priestesses, and wiped dry with clean
towels; possibly its ugliness was set off by golden ornaments
and jewels. In the darkness surrounding the Cyprian deity,
other mysteries were concealed, admission to which was
doubtless only obtainable at a high price. Three ruined walls
and a few fragments of an ancient building; scattered here
and there over great heaps of rubbish, are all that remain
of what once was Paphos. The stones of which it was built,
have disappeared long ages ago, used probably, as materials
wherewith to build the lordly castles of the Middle Ages, or
broken in pieces for the construction of humbler edifices.</p>

<p>During the period that the island was occupied by the
Franks, a new city sprang up upon the site of ancient Paphos,
which has also disappeared; but of this a ruined church, now
used as a cattle-shed, is all that remains. Still, melancholy
as is the present condition of the spot, so suggestive are the
general features of the locality, that it is not difficult to reconstruct
the beautiful landscape it once presented. The
temple was situated upon a broad eminence which sloped
gently towards the sea, which formed, as it were, a border to
the picture. The slope was all covered with luxuriant vegetation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span></p>

<p>Towards the interior of the country are a few outlying
hills, backed by picturesque mountain scenery of a much
grander character than at Baffo. As I looked upon them, the
sky became overcast, and the sea overspread by long masses
of rain clouds, through which at intervals streamed the rays of
the western sun, which, falling on the water, covered its surface
with gleams of dazzling brightness. Some portions of the lovely
scene seemed bathed in gold, only made more conspicuous by
the darker tints of deepest blue and purple. The play of
light and shade was continually changing, forming altogether
a scene of tranquil loveliness not easily to be forgotten. I
should not like, however, to live here alone. Every place to
which the reputation of antiquity attaches itself, has its guide
and dealer in curiosities, although he knows no more about
them than the crows know about Sunday. The man who
accompanied me in my explorations came, as he said, from
Mitylene, and was educated enough to be able to quote the
poems and rhapsodies of Sappho. The owner of a neighbouring
farm, here made his appearance, a stately Turk, in
frock-coat and boots, with a head of hair like that of a
plough-boy. We went together, about a quarter of an hour’s
walk, to see the “Queen’s Cave” (σπήλαιον τῆς ῥηγίνας) which
was upon his estate. This gentleman informed me, that until
about ten years previously it had been almost entirely filled
up, but, that when the French came to explore, he had
had it opened. Nothing, however, was found in it except a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
great stone slab, about five feet square, which was leaning
against one of the walls, and was covered with inscriptions
on both sides. The Frenchmen, after a great deal of trouble,
succeeded in getting it out. It was, however, so heavy that
they broke it to pieces, before taking it with them in their
boat. Cesnola tells us that on descending into the cave he
found that it consisted of four chambers, or tombs excavated
one behind the other in the solid rock. Each of the two first
contained four graves; the third had fewer, and in the last and
smallest, there were none. “We found,” he continues, “several
other tombs upon the side of the hill, some of them open and
some of them filled up. My guide told me that before his time
they had been thoroughly ransacked, and their contents, which
consisted of several gold chains and sundry earthenware vessels,
were taken away. There were also remains of buildings upon
the highest point of the hill, around the foundations of which
considerable excavations had been made, revealing, that the
edifice had been a square tower, one side of which had been
cleared of rubbish, but the hoped-for treasures, which had
been the incentive to all this labour, had not been forthcoming.
The tower seems to have nothing in common with the other
building, and appears to have been simply a watch-tower used
in former times to give warning of the approach of pirates.”</p>

<p>With still increasing pleasure, I continued to gaze upon the
vernal landscape in which all the great historical features of
the place were distinctly traceable, and I would willingly have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
lingered longer upon this enchanting spot, had I not been
recalled to more practical matters by my landlord, who
summoned me to table, where I was soon enjoying a meal
consisting of excellent soup, fresh eggs, maccaroni, and
bean salad, together with some exceedingly good wine.</p>

<p>After dinner the landlord took a seat beside us upon the
terraced roof of the house, and we enjoyed a most delightful
evening. Close to us, in a neighbouring court-yard, sat a
Turkish family, who laughed and joked apparently in
high spirits. Our hostess was still quite a young girl,
and very pretty, her large flashing eyes, white glistening
teeth, and delicately-shaped limbs, formed quite a picture.
At first, when spoken to, she seemed embarrassed and
bashful, and only giggled, but as conversation went on
she became more companionable, seated herself upon the
doorstep, and chattered away merrily. It is a pity that in
these Eastern climes female beauty is so evanescent; even
before girlhood is passed, their charms have disappeared,
leaving nothing behind but a tawny skeleton.</p>

<p>The night was delightful, the air balmy and soft, and each
breath of wind seemed to bring with it the perfume of a
thousand flowers. The silver stars so sparkled and flashed
in the clearness of the atmosphere that they seemed to have
descended towards the earth.</p>

<p>Owing to the warmth of the night the door of my apartment
was open, and as I lay in bed contemplating the dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
blue sky, I could fancy that my vision penetrated beyond the
stars into the depths of the firmament. My mind was so
filled with reflections on the worship of the Cyprian goddess
that I could not sleep. Scenes that I, not long before, had
witnessed in Egypt, during the feast of Machmal, presented
themselves vividly to my mind. According to ancient custom,
the ruler of Cairo sends every year a valuable piece of
cloth, in which to wrap the holy stone, the Caaba. The
setting out of the great caravan which bears this cloth to its
destination is celebrated by a general festival, during the
continuance of which the fanaticism of the Mohammedans
fully displays itself. It was impossible to think of the great
black meteoric stone and the ceremonies connected with it,
without being forcibly reminded of the cone-shaped stone
worshipped with similar rites by the Paphian priesthood.
The Caaba stands surrounded by a wall, exactly as did the
Cyprian idol: even the doves of Venus are not wanting in
the temple court of the Caaba, where they are regarded as
sacred birds. In the sanctuary of Jupiter Ammon, in the
Lybian Desert, the idol was a stone of a conical shape,
ornamented with emeralds and other jewels. In the temple at
Delphos a similar stone was worshipped, was daily anointed
with oil, and on high festivals was wrapped in white wool.
In the same manner we find that in ancient temples, more
especially in Syria and Asia Minor, Bethylia were worshipped;
sacred stones, whose name, derived from Bethel (the place of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
God), indicates their Semitic origin; these stones were all
meteoric, and it is natural enough that when such masses
have fallen amid thunder and lightning, they should be
believed to be of heavenly origin, and to possess extraordinary
attributes.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER XVIII<br /><br />
<small><small>SUMMER RESIDENCE IN CYPRUS.</small></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> an account given by General Cesnola of a similar
journey to mine, across a portion of the island, he states that
travellers in Cyprus will find it much more convenient to
purchase, than to hire, animals, and speaks in high terms of
the well-broken mules and donkeys he found. These donkeys,
of a breed peculiar to Cyprus, are glossy and sleek, with
large eyes; they are very intelligent and can travel as fast as
a mule.</p>

<p>The same authority tells us the muleteers are as a class
excellent and trustworthy, even under the temptation of
conveying large sums of money from one town to the other.
When a native is about to proceed on a journey he goes to
the khan, a kind of inn, and there selects a mule to his
liking, and bargains with the owner of it for a lump sum for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
the entire trip, or at a rate of so much a day. The latter
mode is preferable, for should the mule prove unsuitable,
the traveller would be at liberty to change it on the road
if he found a better. The former method, however, is
generally adopted by the natives for the sake of economy.
He appoints the hour at which he desires to start, and the
muleteer as a rule arrives at the house an hour or two later.
A kind of native saddle is placed on the back of the mule,
called “stratouri,” across which are hung, in such a manner
as not to incommode the traveller, two large canvas bags,
which contain his private effects, and provisions for the first
day’s journey. Several coloured blankets or quilts, according
to the season, are then piled on the stratouri to be used as a
bed at night.</p>

<p>The muleteer, who acts also as guide, is mounted upon a
small but strong donkey in the same fashion as the traveller,
and carries the extra baggage of the latter, besides food for
himself, provender for both animals, and often several parcels
intrusted for delivery to his care. At first it seemed to me
cruel to see such little animals so overloaded, but I soon
became convinced that the Cyprian donkey is stronger, and
resists the fatigue of a long journey, better than a mule.</p>

<p>When everything is in readiness for departure, the
traveller is helped to ascend to the top of his quilts, and two
rusty stirrups attached to the extremities of a rope are handed
him, into which he introduces his feet. By sitting upon the
rope, he is enabled keep to his equilibrium; once safely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
perched he opens a yellow cotton umbrella, lights his
cigarette, receives the blessings of his household, and starts
upon his journey.</p>

<p>The Cypriotes are in general a frugal people, and when travelling,
can accommodate themselves to almost every exigency.
More than once during my excursions in the island I have
found on entering a small village, some wealthy merchant of
my acquaintance, seated cross-legged on the threshold of a
hut, with a straw tray, resembling the lid of a basket, placed
before him, on which were a few black olives, a hard piece of
brown bread, and some sour milk, apparently enjoying his
repast. It is no uncommon thing to find the muleteer seated
opposite the merchant, eating from the same dish, and drinking
from the same jug, a glass being in the interior of the
island considered a useless luxury.</p>

<p>Whilst giving our readers the benefit of the above interesting
particulars we cannot refrain from quoting General
Cesnola’s own account of his summer residence in the interior
of the island. The question of the possibility of enjoying
life in our new possession is now so much discussed, that
the testimony of a gentleman, who has recently resided in the
island for ten years must carry much weight.</p>

<p>“On the occasion of a visit to Nikosia, the capital of the
island, I had passed a night in the village of Dali, which is
about half way between Nikosia and Larnaka, and had remarked
on its outskirts, a grove of lemon and orange trees,
amidst which nestled a small white cottage, connected with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
several outbuildings. This, I decided, might be converted into
a pleasant retreat, and soon induced the proprietor to cede it
to us for small remuneration, during the hot season. This
he did the more readily, as the peasants live almost entirely
out of doors from June to September, it rarely ever happening
that a drop of dew, and almost never a drop of rain, falls
during these months. The Cypriotes place their beds under
the trees, making the branches of the latter do duty as clothes
press and larder. They will frequently throw a handkerchief
on the ground and lay their infants to sleep upon it, satisfied
that neither moisture nor creeping thing will harm the child,
for Dali is wonderfully free from noxious reptiles.</p>

<p>“This simple abode became our summer resort for several
years. It was surrounded by about six acres of ground, laid
out in alleys of lemon and orange trees, and the favourite
caisha,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> from the blossoms of which exhaled a delightful perfume.
Two noble walnut-trees overshadowed the traditional
alakah,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and extended their shade to our out-of-door saloon,
where we sat the day long, reading, writing, and chatting with
the grateful breeze, at all hours coming through the long
verdant alleys, hung with luscious fruit. A small rivulet of
the purest water found its way from cold sources to the feet
of these walnut-trees, the broad leafy branches of which
formed the ceiling of our drawing-room, and being blocked
by a pile of rough stones, tumbled, cascade fashion, into a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>basin, scooped out to receive it, which served as our wine
cooler and refrigerator. We soon adopted the housekeeping
system of the peasants, and hung our plate baskets and table
linen among the trees; and spreading out the thick mats of
the country with a wooden settle dining-table and some rough
chairs, we soon arranged a dining-hall, where our Turkish
attendants served us with as much attention as if at a state
dinner, though not with quite the same ceremony. A little
further on a few Turkish rugs and divans formed the reception
room of state for the notables of Dali, consisting of an
old cadi, an illiterate Greek priest, and three wealthy Turks of
Potamia, who inhabited what was once a royal palace, and the
summer residence of the Lusignan queens.”</p>

<p>We cannot refrain from quoting a still stronger testimony
borne by this gentleman, to the charms of this beautiful
island as a summer residence:</p>

<p>“Having obtained a six months’ leave of absence, we took
our last walk in the environs of Larnaka, where the Marina<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
appears to its best advantage. Passing the Salines, and the
ruins of Phaneromene on our right, we were soon in the
fields, which were yet in all their vernal glory. Pink and
white anemones, dark blue irises, intensely scarlet poppies,
golden Marguerites, and a thousand lovely blossoms, of which
I do not even know the names, embroidered the plains with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>most brilliant colours imaginable. We crushed the wild
thyme and mignonette beneath our feet at every step, yet
they seemed to offer us their incense at parting. A
torrid sun would soon leave all this a dreary waste. Mount
Santa Croce seemed to follow us throughout our walk, ever
changing in aspect, now cool and brown as clouds floated
over it, now glowing with crimson in the setting sun. The
lighted minarets of Larnaka, and the Marina, shone in the
distance, and, as we neared the latter, we heard the voice of
the muezzin calling the faithful to prayer. As we entered
our own spacious garden, which had been reclaimed from the
sea-shore, with its lovely roses—such as bloom only in Cyprus—and
its vine-covered walls, a slight shade of regret passed
over us as we thought how soon neglect might turn the spot,
then the admiration of visitors, once more into an unsightly
waste. An extensive terrace overlooked the garden, and as
we walked on it in the moonlight, a magical charm seemed to
have been thrown on the scene, and on the rippling gleaming
waves of the Mediterranean, so that while gazing we almost
forgot the dark side of life in Cyprus, and a sense of tenderness
stole into our hearts for the land we were leaving on the
morrow.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER XIX<br /><br />
<small><small>CHARACTER OF THE PEOPLE.</small></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> Cyprus we encounter a population which essentially
resembles the modern, rather than the ancient Greek in
character.</p>

<p>One of the most pleasing features of the island is the everyday
domestic life of its inhabitants. The members of every
family cling inseparably together, and share among themselves
whatever good or evil fortune awaits them. To pay
for the education of a son or brother, parents and children
will suffer both want and hunger. Brothers will not marry
until their sisters are provided for, and it is often truly touching
to see how the grey-headed fathers and mothers, who
seem here to be particularly numerous, are honoured and
cared for by their children.</p>

<p>Among the ancient Greeks the men allowed themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
much freedom in love affairs and worshipped at the shrine
of beauty. The women, on the contrary, were chaste and
modest, and lived retired, industriously employed in their
household duties. Such are the Cyprian women at the
present day. The influence of the female part of the community
has, moreover, of late remarkably advanced. Perhaps
among no other people do women hold a more influential position.
The mother is the mistress of the household, and it is
principally by her that the family is held together. It is a
common saying, that men make laws, but women regulate
the manners of a people. The laws, however, are dependent
upon the manners, and the more strictly these latter are
watched over, so much the better for the well-being of the
State. The modern Greeks make the best sailors, and the
most discreet and prudent men of business in the world;
they are good hands at fine work, are fond of horticulture,
and are skilled manufacturers and money dealers. Although
fond of the warm slopes and sunny climate of their native
land, they are ever ready to quit it at a moment’s notice to
seek their fortune elsewhere. They are remarkable among all
the dwellers in the East for their activity and the elasticity of
their spirits, which nothing seems to subdue, and which, when
repressed, is continually breaking out more cheerfully and
brightly than before, like their own sunny sky after the storm
has passed away. They are fond of literature, and are
delighted with a graceful expression, or a witty saying. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
take an interest in everything and delight in talking and
telling tales. Their understanding and imagination in short
are extraordinarily powerful and active.</p>

<p>And now having said so much on the bright side of their
character, we must turn to their vices and faults. Their
laughable conceit, which displays itself in a thousand unexpected
forms, might be passed over, as also the grasping
avarice which is conspicuous in most of their dealings, for
vanity may rise into ambition, and niggardliness be refined
into praiseworthy economy, were their other vices not so
numerous and so grave. In social life we may place falsehood
and faithlessness, knavery and lying, at the head of the
catalogue. Of insatiable covetousness, heartless robbery,
and implacable revenge, examples are numberless. Justice
is so totally set aside that, if a man be placed upon a jury, he
is compelled to acquit the offender, because he thinks in his
heart that he himself may shortly be placed in the same unfortunate
predicament.</p>

<p>If we are asked what is the political condition of Cyprus,
we can only say that it is busied with small matters, in important
affairs it is all baseness and subserviency. No one
can deny to the modern Greeks the possession of political
cunning. Nevertheless, in the great and necessary virtue of
obedience, they are altogether wanting, and officers and soldiers
will discuss and quarrel over political questions, forgetting that
it is the duty of the one to command and of the other to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
obey. No sooner is an important proclamation issued, than
it becomes the subject of criticism, and mockery, but no one
thinks of obeying it.</p>

<p>The modern Greek is one of the slyest, most active, and
most persevering of rascals, but his efforts are all for the
purpose of over-reaching his antagonist, and cheating the
State. In like manner, barefaced simony is practised
throughout the Eastern churches. The whole country is
full of combinations and parties, not employed in establishing
principles, but merely in endeavouring to obtain power in
order to reward their partisans with places and emoluments.</p>

<p>These evils cast so deep a shadow over the modern Greek
that the few bright points remaining—hospitality, public
spirit, courage, and patriotism—almost disappear in the general
gloom.</p>

<p>In ancient times the effeminacy and luxury of the Cypriotes
had passed into a proverb. The worship of Venus assumed
the character of unbridled sensuality, and the young of both
sexes, brought up in the midst of these luxurious festivals,
soon learnt to look upon pleasure as the end and aim of their
existence.</p>

<p>Clearcus de Soli gives the following account of the effeminate
manners of the Cyprian kings: He says, “There were
women attached to the household of the ladies of the royal
family who were called ‘Flatterers;’ at a later date their
name was changed to ‘Clemacides,’ because they were in the
habit of curving their backs into a sort of step for the use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
the ladies as they got into, and came down from, their litters.”
Clearcus speaks angrily of this abject and despicable practice,
which tended to increase the indolence and luxuriousness of
the princesses who kept these women. “But,” he adds, “these
‘Clemacides,’ after having spent the early part of their lives in
the midst of luxury and refinement, are left to an old age of
misery. Decency will not allow me to relate to what degree
of libertinism these women brought the princesses and ladies
of the court. I will only add that practising upon themselves
and upon others all sorts of abominable witchcraft, they
offered by their shameful conduct a spectacle of the most repulsive
vice.”</p>

<p>Clearcus, too, has given us the following description of a
young Paphian king: “This young man carried the refinement
of luxury, to the extent of lying on a bed, or sofa with silver
feet, overspread with a splendid carpet or rug; under his head
were three pillows covered with very fine linen of a rich
colour, and handsomely trimmed. His feet rested upon two
purple cushions, and he was dressed in a white robe. At
some distance from the bed stood slaves, and near the young
king were his flatterers, men of good position.” Clearcus
adds: “Each of these devoted himself in some way to add to
the indolence of the prince. One seated at the foot of the bed
had the young man’s feet resting upon his knees; another
seated near the bed, bent over the hand which the king
allowed him to caress, and gently stretched out one finger
after another; the third, who was highest in rank, stood at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
the head leaning over the cushions and passing his left hand
through the young prince’s hair, whilst with the right he
gently waved a fan.”</p>

<p>To such a height of notorious extravagance had the princes
of Cyprus attained, that Antiphanes, a comic poet of Rhodes,
wrote a most amusing comedy, in which he caricatured the
folly of the Cypriotes.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Manners such as we have described

<small><small>CLIMATE AND TEMPERATURE.</small></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> climate of Cyprus is just now the subject of so much
discussion in England, that we cannot do better than lay the
following facts before our readers, only premising that we
have left our readers to decide between many slight discrepancies
in the various statements. In most respects the
temperature and climate of Cyprus are similar to that of
the neighbouring countries. The great heat of Syria is felt
here, as also the violent winds and extreme dryness of Cilicia;
but to compensate for this, there are most refreshing sea
breezes and night dews. During the summer, as in India,
those who can afford it seek the cool air of the mountains,
returning to their homes in the plains and on the coast for the
winter months, the cold at this season being far more severe
than (judging from the situation of Cyprus) one would imagine.
In the northern parts of the island, the icy winds from Taurus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
are keenly felt, and the summits of the Olympian range are
entirely snow-capped. Old writers have said that the climate
is unhealthy; in proof of this assertion, they mention the
epidemic which attacked the army of St. Louis, in this island,
in 1259, but many who have lived there are not of this opinion.</p>

<p>Abbot Mariti, in his work “Travels in Cyprus,” says, “I
must own that quartan fever is very prevalent in this island,
as in most parts of the Levant; but this is not altogether
caused by the climate. While in Cyprus,” he continues, “I
suffered ten whole months from an attack of this kind of
fever, and I have since learnt, my own indiscretion was
the cause of the long continuance of my ague.” The great
heat of the climate occasions a continual perspiration,
and if, while this lasts, one subjects oneself to the least
chill the result is infallibly an attack of fever. Another
cause is the immoderate use of strong liquors, and the
eating of certain fruits, particularly cucumbers and melons.
Natives of this country rarely escape this epidemic, more
especially in summer, but they cure themselves without
any other remedy than a little bleeding, thus allowing nature
to act. I grant this method would not succeed in the case
of Europeans, for to them the malady has its dangers, and
needs rather careful treatment, but it can be cured by a
rigid system of diet. The Greeks and Turks ward off an
attack by continued horse exercise, and the latter adopt the
not unpleasant remedy of a large glass of good Cyprian wine.</p>

<p>In Cyprus, as in almost all countries of the Levant, rain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
is periodical. It commences falling towards the middle of
October, and continues until the end of January. February
is a less rainy month, and the sky is sometimes cloudless. The
author before quoted, remarks, that “towards the middle of
March the rains commence heavily, and last till the end of
April. May is a delightful month, the refreshing dews aid
vegetation and temper the heat of June. After this season,
the sun has quite a scorching power upon the ground, which
is moistened by neither rain or dew.”</p>

<p>This state of things would be unbearable, were it not for
the refreshing sea-breeze, which is felt on all shores of the
Mediterranean. About the middle of September this wind
ceases, and for six weeks the heat is excessive, until, towards
the end of October, the sky becomes covered with rain
clouds. Thus we see in the summer, the south wind is
refreshing, because it is from the sea, and on the contrary, the
north wind from Asia Minor brings all kinds of unhealthy
vapours. True it is, that the northern parts of the island
suffer less, because the wind has been partly cleared by its
passage over the sea; but it is simply unendurable to the
people of the southern districts, to whom it brings the parching
heat of the hot dry countries, which it has scoured in
crossing the Olympian chain. Should this wind rage for
seven or eight days continuously, all vegetation is injured,
every fruit-tree and plant withered, and the looked-for
harvest wholly at an end. For this reason, scarcity is so
often felt in Cyprus, notwithstanding its fertility and good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
soil. These burning winds, and scorching heat, are the
scourges of the country.</p>

<p>The lower classes of Cypriotes wear large fig or cabbage-leaves
upon their heads to protect them from the rays of the
sun. Strict attention to cleanliness and careful avoidance of
excess in stimulants are necessary in this island as elsewhere.</p>

<p>It would seem that in the climate of Cyprus there must
be something entirely different from that of all the three
countries between which it lies. The climate is, however,
subject to great changes; during one-third of the year, rain
falls abundantly, and during a second third, it is as delightfully
cool, and lovely, as on the coasts of Italy, whilst the
rest of the year is as hot as in the desert of Sahara.</p>

<p>During the winter season it rains incessantly; about the
middle of October, the rain clouds begin to obscure the sky,
and from that time until February the water falls down in
abundance. To this succeeds an exquisite spring, bringing
with it the perfumes of a thousand flowers, and a fresh and
delightful atmosphere.</p>

<p>About the middle of March rain again begins to fall in
passing showers, which, although less violent than those of
winter, continue with more or less intermission until the
middle of May, when they are replaced by the heavy dew
which falls during the night. During this season, which lasts
for about a quarter of a year, the country is a paradise, until
at length comes summer with its burning heat. In June, all
moisture seems to have departed from the atmosphere, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
towards the end of the month, the heat is fearful, and the
sky becomes a changeless expanse of glorious deep blue.
Only from time to time, a fresh sea breeze finds its way to
the land, to indulge the inhabitants with a fresh breath of
air. The worst, however, has yet to come, for towards the end
of September, even these light breezes die away. The air
becomes thick and obscure, and the whole atmosphere damp
and sultry. The grass and vegetation generally are dried up
even to the roots, and the leaves fall from the trees, which
now stretch out their naked arms like ghostly forms, scarcely
visible through the surrounding fog. Not a drop of water
remains in the brooks and river sources, and travelling is
only possible during the night. Business is at a standstill,
and the people do nothing but inquire, how long it will be
before the rain will come again.</p>

<p>It is thought by many that the summer is hotter in Nikosia
than it is in Cairo, notwithstanding that the sea and the
snow-clad hills of Asia Minor are at so short a distance. I
can only account for this circumstance by the fact that in the
valley of the Nile, when the water of the river is rising, there
is always a gentle breeze perceptible, and moreover, from the
broad expanse of water which covers the country, much more
moisture is given off than in the drier atmosphere of Cyprus.</p>

<p>Mariti tells us, that the intensity of the summer heat is
often modified by a cooling wind called imbat.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> This wind,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>which generally commences blowing at two o’clock in the morning
on the first day, increases till noon, then gradually falls,
and towards three o’clock in the afternoon ceases entirely. The
imbat, which begins early in summer, and continues until
September, appears to last about an hour longer each succeeding
day, for five days, when it recommences the five days’
course. If the horizon should be clear the wind will be weak,
but if dark, heavy weather may be expected; occasionally
a dangerous north wind succeeds the imbat, which commences
at seven o’clock in the morning, increases steadily till noon,
and continues blowing till evening. Should this wind last
for any length of time the crops suffer severely.</p>

<p>The same authority mentions, that the cold is never so great
as to necessitate fires in the houses, these being only kindled
to obviate the effects of the excessive moisture. From this
description he, however, excepts the country immediately
around Olympus, where the snow often lies to midsummer.</p>

<small><small>BAFFO AND KUKLIA.</small></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Early</span> next morning, on leaving my sleeping apartment,
I found my dragoman, in company with a young dealer in
Paphian curiosities, hanging about the door, and evidently on
the watch to fasten their company on me, should I attempt
to visit any of the surrounding ruins. Not being desirous of
their interference, or assistance, I evaded them, and quietly
strolled down to the sea-shore. As I looked around, I
observed, against the horizon, the small houses and slender
minarets of Ktima, a little town standing upon raised stone
dikes. Somewhat lower down, a huge mass of sandstone
extended for some little distance along the shore, the
appearance of which at first puzzled me exceedingly.
On the side facing the sea, large and small chambers
were hollowed out, and every here, and there, roughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
hewn steps, led to the top of the rock. Cesnola has made
some of his interesting excavations on this spot, and I
will therefore explain these strange workings, in the solid
sandstone, in his own words:</p>

<p>“A little to the north-east, and half-way between these
ruins and Ktima, there is a rocky eminence sloping towards
the sea, and called Palæo Castro, the surface of which is
perforated with thousands of ancient tombs, some cut vertically,
and others horizontally, in the calcareous rock. Some
are made to contain only one body, while others are large
enough for a score or more. These graves are all evidently
pre-Roman. I had the rubbish removed from one of the
largest, and found it to be an oblong building, with an atrium
supported by three monolithic columns, roughly hewn out of
the limestone, and with a court-yard in front. The tomb
is divided into three chambers, which communicate, inside,
with each other, but have separate entrances. They
have a large number of niches, seven feet by two, each
to contain one body. Near the wall facing the doorway of
each chamber, there is a low platform hewn in the rock,
on which apparently stood a sarcophagus, but nothing of it
now remains. The court-yard contains also several single
graves, but all have been opened long ago. This must have
been the family sepulchre of a great personage, and possibly
that of one of the kings of Paphos.”</p>

<p>The same authority gives the following particulars concerning
the contents of some similar tombs he examined at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
Amathus, and other excavations made by him at Paphos,
with, however, but little result.</p>

<p>“The quantity of objects in copper and bronze discovered
in these tombs, though mostly destroyed by oxidisation, is
much greater than that found in the extensive necropolis of
Idalium. I observed that in the localities where copper mines
are known to have existed, as at Amathus and Curium, more
ancient utensils and figures in that metal are found. The
fact that these bronze objects are roughly made, is sufficient
proof that they have not been imported, but are of
native manufacture. Many curious little rings in bronze
and in silver were met with in these tombs, the use of
which it is not easy to determine. Some cylinders of soft
glazed clay, probably of Babylonian or Egyptian manufacture,
also came to light, together with several rings of
solid gold of very rough workmanship, and entirely without
artistic merit; broken earthenware jars, bronze bowls, copper
hatchets, and a few iron arrow-heads were found, but all
oxidised, so as to fall into powder, and entirely without
inscriptions. West of these tombs, facing the sea, are to be
found nine oven-shaped caverns, which contain a great quantity
of human bones, besides those of oxen, camels, and sheep.
These nine caverns are far too small to have contained the
amount of bodies indicated by the skeletons (I counted no
less than sixty-four human heads), but were more probably
simply ossuaries for bones removed from rock-cut tombs, so
soon as the tomb was required for another occupant, and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
tenant dried up and forgotten. The fact that no sepulchral
vases or any other such relics are to be found, sufficiently bears
out such a supposition. In the tombs on the sea-shore, only
the bones of pigeons and egg-shells in clay dishes were to be
found with the human remains, these being evidently the
relics of the funeral feast.”</p>

<p>During the week Cesnola remained at Ktima, he made
many excavations; one of these was upon the site of a temple
of which three large granite columns were still standing; he
also discovered the bases of nine other columns, only a few
inches below the surface, and still occupying their original
position, whilst all around were strewn architectural fragments
which had belonged to that structure. On the other
spot he investigated is a broken column, to which it is asserted
St. Paul was tied and scourged when he came to preach the
Gospel in this city; but the tradition is said to be only current
amongst the Greeks of Ktima. In this locality there
were also shafts of columns, some blocks of triglyphs and
volutes lying on the ground, probably also the remains of a
temple. A silver coin of Vespasian, with the Temple of
Paphos upon it, and a few Roman lamps, were all the relics
that were found after a week’s exploration.</p>

<p>Before quitting the neighbourhood of Paphos, the same
authority visited the village of Koloni, which is situated upon
a plain, stretching down to the sea, overshadowed by hills
covered with juniper-trees. In these rocks are situated the
“asbestos” quarries, of which we have already spoken, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
the much lauded “Paphian diamond,” which, however, is
only a superior quality of rock crystal. These hills, we are
told, yield fossil shells in large quantities; and earths of
different colours, green, carmine, and yellow, are occasionally
met with in the surrounding district.</p>

<p>Ten minutes’ ride from Koloni, in a north-west direction,
is Ieroskipo, now a mere group of houses. This name is
evidently derived from the ancient Hieroskepi, “Sacred
Garden,” the well-known garden of Venus, who was regarded
by her worshippers as the goddess of gardens and flowers.
Cupid was supposed to have lived with her in Cyprus.</p>

<p>“There is,” says Cesnola, “a large cave which seems to
have been artificially scooped out of the rock through which
a spring makes its way, and after filling the basin overflows
and forms a rivulet sufficient to water the neighbouring
fields; this is known as the ‘Bath of Aphrodite.’
I must say, he would be obdurate indeed who would not be
captivated by the great beauty of the spot. The ground
generally slopes gently towards the sea, but here it seems
to have been cut into large plateaux or terraces, which are
surrounded by a thick grove of olive-trees, many centuries
old. Among the olives is a sprinkling of carob-trees, which,
with their dark green and lustrous foliage, form a striking
contrast to the pale hue of the olive leaf. In closer proximity
to Ieroskipo, are a number of rock-cut tombs, but no vestige
of buildings are visible.”</p>

<p>After wandering some distance farther along the sand, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
reached Kapatah, a fortress built upon the shore by the
Genoese, and here came upon more tombs cut in the rock,
and entered by means of roughly hewn steps. Over the
largest of these chambers, I observed an inscription in ancient
Cyprian characters, and in the grotto itself, which
is divided into two apartments, the hindermost of which has
a small cupola at its top, I also noticed half effaced characters
upon the walls. Near this spot was the ancient harbour,
the dams of which were formed of blocks of stone; a
stream now discharges itself here. I was told that the harbour
had formerly extended much further inland, and had gradually
fallen into ruin, and been filled up with sand. The sea was
plashing against the stones in the foreground, the flowering
shrubs of all kinds filled the air with fragrant perfumes, and
in the distance towered the dark and lofty mountains.</p>

<p>Proceeding onwards, after leaving this fort, I came upon
a village embowered in trees and inhabited by Greeks and
Turks. The walls, as is commonly seen in the district,
appeared to be constructed principally of stones taken from
the surrounding ruins, and I noticed many a piece of broken
column peeping out from its hiding-place, among waving
palms and flowering shrubs. Near a little church I observed
some small pillars, two of white marble, and two of beautifully
polished granite. Of another church only a square
tower and the portion of an arch remain. In the midst of
the village is a roomy basin, formed of large blocks of stone,
which was, no doubt, the bath of the fair Cyprians of ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
times; now it is merely a receptacle for refuse. As I proceeded
farther into the village I found huge blocks of marble
and granite lying in all directions. The French, we are told,
in the course of their explorations here ten years ago, brought
to light many valuable relics, and carried off the best of all
they found. Knowing this, I was perfectly astonished at the
rich treasures of antiquity that met my eye at every step,
and I could only suppose the place to be the site of a former
city, over the buried temples and palaces of which trees and
shrubs had sprung up, and a few small houses for the present
poor inhabitants been hastily erected. The people still
draw their water from the ancient limpid springs. Even the
higher class of Turkish houses, which were comparatively
modern, showed here and there traces of walls and gateways
of an early date. During the time of the Emperor Augustus
a violent earthquake destroyed New Paphos, and in obedience
to imperial commands the city that rose upon its ruins was
named after his wife, Augusta. At a later period, a second
earthquake destroyed the unfortunate town; but we have no
clue as to the date of this second calamity. I could not but
groan in spirit as I walked and thought of all the treasures
that probably lay buried beneath my feet.</p>

<p>That evening I dined at the table of my worthy friend the
bishop, whose liberal hospitality had made me acquainted with
a great variety of strange dishes. On this occasion the repast
seemed very homelike to me, for it consisted of an excellent
roast leg of mutton served with some fine juicy lettuces, a dish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
of onions stuffed with rice, and a great variety of sweet dishes,
all excellent in their way, and principally samples of Turkish
cookery. This was followed by toasted bread covered with
layers of rich cheese, after which came coffee, and our ten
feet long chibouks.</p>

<p>During the evening many priests of various ranks dropped
in, said a few words, and again departed. It seemed to me
they had very much their own way with their good-hearted
bishop. These visitors were followed by the kaimakan, or
governor, who appeared followed by half a dozen attendants.
This gentleman chatted with us for an hour, and then left,
begging me to allow him to send an escort with me on my
journey of the following day.</p>

<p>Early next morning I proceeded on my way, and as we
approached Hierokipu, I saw many grottos hewn in the rock,
and noticed again and again that the ground over which
we passed sounded hollow as it was struck by our horses’
hoofs. I was informed by a gentleman we met, who owned
property in the neighbourhood, that two years ago he had
found a place in which were five chambers hollowed in the
rock, with a kind of entrance hall in front neatly constructed
of square blocks of stone; within this stood a round pillar
which had no doubt served as an altar. Many of the odd
little flasks and vessels were found here which have been
supposed (in my opinion most absurdly) to have been receptacles
for tears. These contained resin and ointment, the
perfume of which filled the whole chamber. When we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
only some few hours’ distance from Old Paphos or Kuklia,
I rode down to the shore and took a survey of the surrounding
view. The mountain gullies were now dry, but at other
seasons, it was evident that the whole coast would be flooded
by the streams that flowed through them during the wet
season. I now ascended a slight eminence on which once
was the site of a temple built by Ptolemy Philadelphus,
and dedicated to his beautiful spouse Arsinœ, who was
there worshipped under the name of Venus Zephyritis.
Dinochaus, the architect who completed the temples of Diana
Ephesus, we are told, contemplated making the temple of
Arsinœ of loadstones, with a statue of the queen suspended
in the air by the power of magnetism, but he died before the
strange idea could be carried out. The daughter of this
queen was the fair Berenice, whose beautiful locks have been
so celebrated. This lady dedicated her luxuriant tresses to
the goddess should her husband, Ptolemy Evergetes, whom
she tenderly loved, return uninjured from the war he was
then engaged on. After three years he did return, ladened
with spoil. All the south part of Asia Minor had submitted
to him, and he erected two temples in commemoration of his
victories there, calling them Arsinœ and Berenika. On this
successful issue of her petition the fair wife of the conqueror
at once cut off her magnificent tresses, and had them suspended
in the temple of her mother, the so-called Venus
Zephyritis, Cyprus in those days being united with Egypt
under the Ptolemies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span></p>

<p>What became of this wonderful hair is unknown, but
Konou of Samos, the astronomer, announced, by way of
flattering the lovely queen, that “Jove himself had stolen the
tresses and placed them in the sky as a constellation.”</p>

<p>The “Sacred Road,” which took its name from the number
of worshippers carrying their offerings, who formerly passed
backwards and forwards between Old and New Paphos,
gradually rose slightly above the shore, and as I looked
around I could not avoid noticing the great beauty of the sea
foam as it rose in snowy wreaths from the stones on which it
beat. At some seasons, when a south-west wind is blowing,
this foam rises as high as the feet of the trees and shrubs,
and presents the appearance of small tracks of snow. The
shore at this point, I am told, would afford a rich field for
the naturalist; I myself saw millions of crustaceans and
microscopical creatures lying upon the stones. Gazing upon
the scenes I could readily suppose how the vivid imagination
of the Grecian temperament should have led them to describe
the Goddess of Love as having first reached the shores of
Cyprus mounted on the foamy crest of a wave.</p>

<p>Cesnola tells us, that the two Christian churches, now both
in ruins, one of which was built within the area of the temple,
and the other within the boundary wall, the palace of the
Lusignans, and the entire village of Kuklia, have been constructed
with the stone from the ruins of the ancient city.
Attached to each house is a penfold, built without mortar, of
loose stones. The church that stands within the temple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
limits has several fine marbles embedded in its walls, bearing
inscriptions, which had obviously belonged to some more
ancient edifice, before they were placed in their present
positions.</p>

<p>An old ruined castle, and a few miserable dwelling-houses,
are all that now remain of what was once Old Paphos, now
known as Kuklia. We rested for a time in a wretched
coffee-house, which was full of zaptiehs, who were quartered
here, whilst they collected over-due taxes. Groups of people
stood around, some looking pitiable objects with their wan,
anxious countenances, whilst others again were perfect embodiments
of cunning and stupidity. The chief officer of the
soldiers, when I arrived, was addressing this crowd with polite
dignity and a great variety of expressive gestures. It was
whispered in my ear by one of the party, that rage and
threaten as their rulers might, no more money could be
wrung from this wretched population. In respect to their
extreme poverty, these miserable beings appeared to me to
be no worse off than the inhabitants of Ktima and other
places we passed through. A few stalwart men were amongst
the crowd, but for the most part the people appeared weakly,
and to blend the Grecian, Syrian, and Italian types of
countenance. After vainly endeavouring to persuade some
Turkish family to give us lodging, we were glad at last to
take refuge in a kind of very high shed, the mud walls of
which contained but one room. In this I camped with all
my three servants. A carpet and coverings were procured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
and with these we made ourselves as comfortable as circumstances
would permit. After a short rest I issued forth to
examine this wretched place, and standing upon the flat roof
of a hut that stood below ours, I obtained a clear view of my
surroundings. The whole place appeared to be a mere heap
of ruins, the pillars and foundations of ancient palaces. The
heights around exhibited a few yellow flowering shrubs,
interspersed with green palms and other trees, whilst around
and about this scene of desolation stood the dwellings of
the poverty-stricken inhabitants. Below me was the court-yard
of a Turkish house, in which I could see the women at
their work. They wore veils, and I could not help noticing
how much they seemed to inconvenience them, as they threw
them first on one side and then to the other, to be out of
their way.</p>

<p>I now descended and proceeded to explore the Aditum, the
only ancient sacred edifice in Cyprus, which, thanks to the
pictures of it found on gems and coins, we can reproduce
before our eyes. It had, apparently, been a square building
with a fine entrance, and a low wing at either end. On each
side of the portal were two obelisks. This temple was surrounded
by a barrier, in the centre of which stood the
principal altar. In the innermost recesses of this edifice once
stood the mysterious veiled stone of Astarte Aphrodite.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER XXII<br /><br />
<small><small>EPISKOPI.</small></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning I could not resist taking another look at
Old Paphos, and accordingly made my way to the heights
behind the village, in order to impress the charming landscape
as deeply as possible upon my memory. The morning air
was delightfully fresh, the far-reaching coast was fringed with
narrow lines of foam left by the rippling water, but the sea
itself lay heavy and motionless as a sheet of metal. The
mountains were partially concealed by a misty veil, only the
village being clearly seen surrounded by its verdant fields.</p>

<p>On returning I entered the little coffee-house, which on the
preceding day had afforded me by no means bad accommodation.
The master sat before the door smoking his
chibouk. He immediately, respectfully, made room for me,
and I sat a short time conversing with him by signs. On
recommencing our journey, we walked for about a mile
along the sea-shore, after which we turned more inland and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
entered a myrtle copse. The farther we advanced the more
luxurious the country became. The undergrowth of bushes
was interspersed with wild roses, orchids, and many luxuriant
flowers, the varied colours of which enlivened the green grass
over which our course lay. Here we encountered some
women engaged in cutting off the heads of thistles. Hussein
begged a handful of these in order to let me taste the seeds,
which he shelled out from the husks. I found them rather
dry but not bad to eat; in fact, almost all the vegetables in
the island afford something edible. A grey-headed old woman
sold us some wild artichokes, and told us to eat them raw, but
they were too coarse to be palatable.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The old dame was
dressed after the Turkish fashion, and kept her face closely
veiled.</p>

<p>Our path now lay through a deep dell, and was covered
with brushwood, while around us were cypresses, olives, and
various fruit-trees, but all utterly neglected. A hundred
thousand people might find ample sites here for most delightful
residences. As I was walking along, I trod upon a snake.
It was of a grey colour marked with black rings, about a foot
and a half long, and as thick as my arm. A powerful scent
of melons was perceptible here and there, and on seeking for
the cause, I found it came from some yellow berries, which
grew upon a, to me, strange plant. The underwood was
full of game, and many birds whose names were unknown
to me were flying about. One, I especially noticed, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>closely resembled a jay, but was more brilliantly marked with
blue and red.</p>

<p>According to my map we ought to have passed through
three villages. Hussein, however, either knew a shorter way
or participated in my love for solitude. Not a single village
did we see; but we got a glimpse of Adimu at a great distance.
Hussein, instead of taking me right over the heights
of Old Kurion brought me again into the plain, assuring me
most confidently that there was nothing to be seen there but
a couple of large stones. Ross informs us that twenty years
ago he saw there the remains of an ancient race-course, and
the foundations, and some fragments of pillars belonging to
the Temple of Apollo Hylades. Except these, my guide declared
there is no longer the slightest trace of these structures
left visible. I well believe it, for during the last few years
all seem to have been bent upon removing the last remnants
of antiquity left in Cyprus, as though anxious to make the
work of destruction complete. Whenever a building is to be
erected either in Syria or in Egypt, it is to Cyprus they come
for stone, taken from her old walls and bridges.</p>

<p>Right under the rock of Kurion, and not far from Episkopi,
we came again to the sea, which, during the day, had so often
delighted us. As we wound round the rocks, it sometimes
seemed as though its laughing blue waters, enclosed between
the far extending capes, was contained in an enormous bowl.</p>

<p>Cesnola tells us, that, along the southern coast of the island
are several guard-houses, built near the shore, on elevated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
ground, some of which, now dismantled and roofless, are of
Turkish construction, and two or three hundred years old.
Most of them appear to have been erected for the protection
of the neighbouring villages against Algerine pirates,
who, not more than sixty years ago, were daring enough to
land and carry off wealthy inhabitants, and to detain them
until the required ransom was paid.</p>

<p>From the heights above Episkopi one could see the long
chain of mountains, looking as if they had been carefully
folded one behind the other. The whole peninsula had the
appearance of a great plank, both ends of which sloped off
into the sea. In ancient times it was named Kurias, and
belonged to a town of the same name, built upon the neighbouring
sandstone rock.</p>

<p>The hills are situated at the beginning of the peninsula,
just where the stream Lycos discharges itself into the sea,
amid thickets of orange and other fruit trees, above which the
slender stems of lofty palm-trees rear themselves gracefully
into the air. Everywhere among the houses and gardens
little brooks make their way through the fruitful plain. I could
almost suppose the ancient Kurion, must have been situated
here, and that the rock above us was merely its acropolis.</p>

<p>Hussein left us in this beautiful spot whilst he went into
the town to seek a lodging; the inhabitants were of a much
higher grade than at Paphos. The Turks find everything here
that their hearts desire—quiet, green trees, and murmuring
streams. Several little groups of veiled women passed us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
with dark brown eyes gleaming above the covering of their
faces. I was informed that the Turks, who principally
inhabited this beautiful place, finding a scarcity of women,
had imported all these dark-faced beauties from Egypt.</p>

<p>After we had wasted some time, Hussein came back with
the news that the Greek population of Episkopi were so poor
that we could procure neither beds, food, nor wine. The
Turkish houses were all full; nobody appeared willing to
receive us, and to quarter ourselves upon them uninvited was
out of the question. Notwithstanding the episcopal name of
the town, so far from there being any bishop there, the Turks
had driven all the Greek priests out of it, leaving only a few
poor huts at the disposal of the Christian population, and even
the occupants of these could not receive a stranger without
permission of their Turkish neighbours.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER XXIII<br /><br />
<small><small>KOLOSSIN.</small></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> our approach to this village, I sent forward my dragoman
to secure us lodgings for the night. As we followed him
at the distance of about a mile we saw a huge square tower
standing on a farmstead, and on advancing found that it was
a building belonging to mediæval times, but whether it had
been part of a castle or a fortress I was unable to determine.
The owner received us at the entrance of the court-yard in the
kindest manner. He was a man of substance and good deportment,
holding a position similar to that of the owner of a
vineyard on the Rhine, and his house very much resembled
that of a small farmer in the South of France. The lower
part of the house was occupied by his numerous family. He
himself lived in the upper part, to which we ascended by a
wooden staircase leading from a kind of entrance hall. The
furniture in these comfortable apartments had something of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
a European aspect; in the room were some fine greyhounds of
a light yellow colour. Our host informed us that there were
fifteen yoke of oxen upon the farm, but there was land enough
to give employment to ten times the number.</p>

<p>After a short rest, we went to inspect the tower, under the
guidance of the owner, who had ordered the servants to light
it up from top to bottom with torches. It is a massive
square building, with walls so thick that benches were placed
in the recesses of the windows. A very simple coat-of-arms,
carved in stone upon the exterior, shows that it was erected
in the thirteenth century. The whole is a fine specimen of
the very few baronial castles that remain. This structure is in
excellent preservation, and furnishes a good example of Anglo-Norman
architecture. I do not think that in all Europe there
is any building of the sort in such good condition, except
perhaps the well-known castle at Hedingham.</p>

<p>There are two lofty stories above the ground, and a deep
cellar-like excavation beneath the level of the soil. The latter
is divided into three compartments, and each of the former
into two roomy chambers. Over the fireplaces are carved
lilies, without any ornamentation, exactly resembling those
represented in the coat-of-arms upon the outer wall. The
portal is narrow, and a flight of small stone steps leads from
one story to another; at the top is a broad platform surrounded
by battlements. In the cellar there is a deep cistern or well
partially filled up. The owner talked of having it cleared
out, and I wished that he might have the luck to find some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
treasure at the bottom, to repay him for the bad harvests of
the last two years, which, owing to want of rain, had been very
scanty.</p>

<p>Manifestly the whole building had been constructed, not so
much for a residence as for defensive purposes. It is situated
near the middle of the peninsula, just where on the one hand
the ground slopes towards the sea, and on the other spreads a
wide amphitheatre of hills; it thus at once commands the sea,
the coast, and the surrounding mountain region. This colossal
structure must evidently have been unassailable by fire, by
ladders, or by breaching the walls, while its defenders if hard
pressed could retreat from one story to another. Under the
battlements were numerous loop-holes, through which arrows
might be shot with deadly precision against an advancing
enemy.</p>

<p>The prospect from the lofty platform was extensive and
beautiful. Sunset was rapidly approaching, and the clouds,
illuminated by the departing rays of the glorious orb, were
arranged in blood red masses and streaks, whilst beneath, the
deep blue of the tranquil sea was here and there lighted up
by broad patches of golden splendour. The mountains,
however, were shrouded in a veil of grey mist. Low beneath
us was the old church, whose architecture seemed a mixture
of the ancient Roman with the earliest Gothic.</p>

<p>I learned that these old castles were crown property and
belonged to the Sultan. During the course of our conversation
the origin and intention of the building became mani<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>fest
to me. I found that I was in the very centre of the world-renowned
Commanderia. The Knights of St. John, after
they were obliged to quit the Holy Land, established the head
quarters of their order at Cyprus, just as at a later period they
did in Rhodes and Malta. From Cyprus they issued forth
under the protection and leadership of its knightly king, to
fight gloriously against the Crescent, and very frequently
the victory was due to the courage and prowess of these
soldiers of the Church. The Bishop of Akkon, Jacques de
Vitrey, in his account of the Holy Land gives us the following
sketch of the Knights Templars:</p>

<p>“Covered with their white mantles, which were embroidered
with a red cross, with their black and white banner
‘Beauseant,’ they rush forward to battle in silence. They
have no war-cry. As soon as the general’s trumpet sounds,
they lay their lances at rest, and repeating from one of the
Psalms of David ‘Lord give us the victory, not for us but
for thy holy name,’ they throw themselves upon the strongest
part of the enemies’ forces. They never give way! they must
break through or die! Does one of the brotherhood lose
heart, he is deprived of his mantle and all his knightly
honours for a year, and must eat his meals from the ground,
without a tablecloth, disturbed by the dogs, that he is forbidden
to drive away.” The order already possessed a
“commande” (as the possessions of the knights were called)
in Cyprus, and important privileges were conferred upon them
by King Hugo I., in the year 1210. They were allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
to acquire territory, wherever they wished, to import or export
all sorts of produce, and to grind their corn without charge in
the king’s mills, which were situated on the stream Kythrea,
near Buffavento. They had residences and gardens in
Nikosia and Limasol, where the head-quarters of the order
were established, and in addition to this occupied Platanistia
and Finika, in the district of Paphos, and Mamgrallu and
Kolossin in the district of Limasol.</p>

<p>In Kolossin, a French proprietor had possession of considerable
domains, all of which were bought by the king and
presented to the knights. And now Kolossin became their
head-quarters; here dwelt the general of the order, and here
was built, during the first part of the thirteenth century, the
strong castle, which during war was their fortress, and in
peaceful times the place where the festivals and assemblies of
the order were held. Towards the close of the Middle Ages,
not fewer than forty-one districts belonged to them in
Cyprus. Their knowledge of husbandry and business-like
habits enabled the Knights of St. John to bring their estates
into a very thriving condition. The cultivation of corn, oil,
vines, sugar-cane, and cotton increased in a wonderful
manner, and because wine was produced only in the one
district, or because the wine of that district surpassed the rest
in quality, it was called Commanderia wine, and Kolossin was
regarded as the centre of the wine-growing region.</p>

<p>We thankfully remembered the brave knights as we sat
at table and tasted the excellent wine still produced on these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
hills. From them likewise the islanders learned how to preserve
the little birds called beccafices, by simply plucking
them, and packing them in jars filled with wine. The wine
soaks thoroughly into the flesh, which becomes slightly
hardened, and of most delicious flavour. Great numbers of
these delicate little birds are killed in Cyprus.</p>

<p>The export of wine might easily be made a source of great
wealth to the inhabitants; as matters at present stand, the
wine imported has to pay a duty of one-sixteenth of its value,
but fifty times more than is now grown might be produced
from the rich lands, which at present lie waste and useless.</p>

<p>It is a wonder how, seeing the rude manner in which the
wine is made, that it is so good as it is. Very little trouble is
taken with it. Goats and young donkeys wander at their
own wicked will through the vineyards during the early part
of the year, and feed upon the young grapes. The clusters
are gathered without the slightest selection, and thrown upon
the ground, where probably they may remain until soaked
with rain. After lying for a week to rot, they are pressed
in the roughest way; the must is poured into large earthen
vessels, which are frequently put into a room where rancid
oil, grain, dried leaves, fruit, and all sorts of bad smelling
things are standing and hanging around. In this polluted
atmosphere the must has to undergo two fermentations.
Over the earthen pot that contains the wine a flat slate is
laid, or a cover with a little hole in it, through which at
intervals a straw is introduced and a mouthful sucked out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
partly as a drink, but perhaps more properly to ascertain how
the wine is getting on; it may have grown sour or it may
not. Should the fermentation have proved successful, the
merchants come, ready to bargain about the price. This
wine is kept in casks, through which the air is allowed to
pass, and after a year is considered to be in good condition.
As in many neighbouring countries, it is the custom in Cyprus
to buy wine when a child is born and keep it to be drunk at
its marriage feast.</p>

<p>Commanderia is first the colour of a topaz, and then becomes
deep red, finally attaining the hue of good curaçoa.
Muscadine, the second quality of Cyprian wine, is very
sweet and has a slight violet tinge when new, after some
years it attains the thickness of syrup. Mavro, a dark red
wine, is also much drunk in Cyprus; it is very dry and
resembles Chateau Margaux.</p>

<small><small>SOIL AND MINERAL PRODUCTS.</small></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A glance</span> at the map shows us that the island of Cyprus is
naturally divisible into three regions, all widely differing from
each other. Along the entire length of its northern division
there runs a long range of low hills, close to the sea, varying
in height from two to three thousand feet, composed of
Jura limestone, flanked on either side by Vienna sandstone.</p>

<p>The western and southern portions, constituting at least half
of the island, are covered with mountains from two thousand
to six thousand feet high. These lofty ridges and projecting
peaks, as well as the whole northern half of the district, consist
of greenstone, while towards the south they are principally
composed of marl and tertiary limestone.</p>

<p>Between these two ranges of mountains there is an extensive
plain covered with rich alluvial soil, which in many places
is from ten to fifteen, or even twenty feet deep, through which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
run streams, converging into two rivers, one of which takes
its course to the eastern, the other to the western, side of the
island. Both of these streams during the rainy season overflow
their banks, inundating the country far and wide, so
that a man unprovided with a boat may be detained for weeks
together, unable to pass from one place to another. When
the water evaporates, or is drained off, it leaves a slimy deposit
which, in its properties and chemical composition, resembles
in a remarkable manner the sediment deposited from the
inundations of the Nile.</p>

<p>All round the island extends a narrow level beach, flanked
by gently rising hills, consisting of post tertiary strata mixed
with gypsum, lime, and marl. Here we find a most productive
soil, watered by innumerable streams and brooks,
which pour down from the hills; moreover, between the hills
are many fruitful valleys and stretches of fertile land, which
would richly repay proper cultivation.</p>

<p>On account of its many capes the map of old Cyprus somewhat
resembles a horned head, and the very peculiar narrow
peninsula, along which the northern chain of mountains is
continued may be compared to the tongue, with which it
seems to be licking the corner, between Syria and Asia
Minor.</p>

<p>The extensive plains have been celebrated from the remotest
antiquity for their gardens and cornfields. On the slopes,
around the coast, and in the deep valleys among the hills, may
be found all the plants and trees that are met with in Europe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
Western Asia and Egypt; these thrive prodigiously indeed.</p>

<p>In former years, the island was celebrated for its valuable
copper mines, hence is supposed to be derived its ancient
name χυπρος, from which we get Cyprus. The most important
copper mines were formerly at Tamassus, in the centre
of the island; at Soli, on the north coast; and Amathus and
Cyricum on the south coast. Gold and silver were occasionally
found. Salt is still made in large quantities, and
coal is found occasionally. Volcanic eruptions, which were
formerly not infrequent, have not occurred for many years;
the island is, however, subject to earthquakes. Precious
stones in great varieties, including the diamond, emerald,
jasper, opal, and agate, were formerly found in this island.
Yellow ochre and amber are also amongst the mineral productions.
Baffo produces a very superior kind of asbestos,
which is known as “stone-cotton” in Cyprus. It is quite
white and as flexible as silk. The ancients made it into
cloth, which was incombustible. This manufacture is still
carried on in some parts of the island, where the cloth is
employed to make the sacramental robes of the priests.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER XXV<br /><br />
<small><small>NATURAL PRODUCTS.</small></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> will now give our readers a general sketch of the rise
and decline of Cyprian agriculture under different rulers.</p>

<p>For nearly three hundred years the dynasty of Lusignan
ruled over a flourishing and important country. Monks,
knights, merchants, and priests thronged to its hospitable
shores, on their way to and from adjoining countries, and many
fair dames were conducted so far, and found pleasant refuge
in Cyprus, whilst their chivalrous husbands journeyed farther
east, to assist in the vain attempt to obtain possession of the
tomb of Christ, and earn either an early grave, or return
covered with wounds and glory. Towns sprang up in all
directions. Wine, oil, silk, cotton, the carob-tree (Ceratonia
siliqua), and the various plants used for the famous Cyprian
dyes, were again largely cultivated, and in the overflowing
markets of the towns upon the coast, ships in adjacent seas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
found the readiest means of victualling for distant voyages.
Mining operations were recommenced with ardour, and Cyprian
merchants again sent forth the rich products of the
island into all parts.</p>

<p>We have still to notice what was the fate of the island,
under Venetian and Turkish domination. The Venetians,
anxious to derive every possible emolument from their possessions,
urged the population to the most strenuous efforts,
in the culture of the land, and when the weary labourers
sank under the burden and heat of the day, used every
incentive, and even punished them, in order to increase their
exertions in bringing their fields and gardens to the required
perfection. There is still a tradition in the island that the
Venetians paid a zechin for every olive-tree that was planted.
Generation after generation, however, the population degenerated,
and became weaker and more idle.</p>

<p>The Venetians would appear to have considered the island in
the light of a great and valuable farm, which they endeavoured
to make as productive as possible. They appointed three
governors, two treasurers, a superintendent with two thousand
men under him, placed a captain and a company of soldiers
in each of the twelve districts into which the land was divided,
who kept everything in order, and took care that the fields
and gardens were well cultivated, and the taxes regularly
paid. After deducting all expenses, Cyprus yielded to Venice
a clear yearly profit of two millions of ducats (golden
dollars). The Italian revenue officers seem not to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
much trusted in their dealings with the Cypriotes, and were
changed every two years.</p>

<p>When the Sultan of Egypt subsequently took Cyprus, the
yearly tribute exacted amounted to eight hundred thousand
ducats (golden dollars); it now produces only seven millions
of marks, a very small sum, in comparison with what it produced
to its Venetian masters.</p>

<p>During the fifteenth century, the blighting influence of
successive wars was keenly felt, and the best energies of the
Lusignans were devoted to warding off the repeated attacks
of the Mussulmans. Since the New World had arisen in the
West, strong and vigorous immigrants no longer lent their
aid to prop a declining state. The conquest of Cyprus by
the Turks cost the island the last remnant of its industrious,
enterprising, and independent inhabitants, and the bloodstained
and desolate country was no longer cultivated. The
Turks, always passionate admirers of flowers, introduced a
few tulips and hyacinths, and planted date-palms in the spots
they occupied; but the soil was not congenial to them, and
in Cyprus the date-palm rarely produced its sweet and highly-prized
fruit.</p>

<p>The tobacco plant was also introduced at this period, but
its cultivation was never carried on to any great extent, owing
to the necessity of planting it in gardens surrounded by high
walls, in order to protect the plant from the depredations
of the locust. No attempt was made on the part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
Turkish Government to rouse the dying energies of the
people; slowly, but surely, every art and industry declined,
and the locust swarmed over the barren and neglected
country.</p>

<p>Thus, in ancient times, we see that the island of Cyprus
was celebrated for its varied vegetation, but of the plants
that once grew there, many are totally lost, others are now
cultivated with difficulty, and very few new ones are added
to the list. The vegetation of Cyprus, like its history, seems
to have undergone many changes, and from the nature of the
soil, is very diversified in different parts of the island. At the
present day, corn is still extensively cultivated; wheat, barley,
oats, and beans flourish well. Upon the mountains grow fir and
pine-trees, and in the valleys we find fine oaks, ashes, orange,
fig, citron, date, walnut, and a great variety of other trees.
Overhanging shrubs crowd the deep dells and precipitous
cliffs, and amongst them grow the oleander, myrtle, arbutus,
juniper, and mastic. Not less striking is the lovely carpet
of flowers, which clothes the face of the country with ever-varying
beauties. Roses and jasmine, tulips, hyacinths, narcissus,
and anemones, are but a few of those that I might
enumerate.</p>

<p>In Cyprus the use of manure is unknown, but nevertheless
there is but little change in the luxuriant fertility of the soil,
and wherever the earth is sufficiently supplied with moisture,
a thousand plants spring up in rich profusion. One of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
principal difficulties in the field is to keep the corn from being
smothered by weeds. This task of weeding falls entirely to
the lot of the women.</p>

<p>Olive-trees were formerly very numerous, as is proved by
the large reservoirs for oil to be seen near Larnaka. The
trade was at one time very extensive, but the island now consumes
all that it produces. This decline would appear to date
from the era of Venetian rule, when the trade in oil was
almost ruined, and the cultivation of the olive abandoned
for that of cotton. Saffron, rhubarb, and many other
natural and valuable productions are also neglected.</p>

<p>Cyprus had once a lucrative trade with Syria, in the oil
extracted from the seed of the jujube tree. Oil of glasswort
was also formerly extracted. Cucumis colocynth, from the
pulp of which colocynth is made, is also largely cultivated:
this plant grows like the water-melon, and belongs to the same
family. The cotton-plant, which was formerly so important
a production, is now comparatively but little cultivated. The
seeds of the cotton-plant are sown early in April, three or
four being planted together, at equal distances. When the
shoots appear above the ground, the strongest plant alone is
allowed to remain, the rest being weeded out. The plants
are hoed in June or July, and the cotton collected in October
and November. The cottons of Cyprus, which are of four
qualities, are much esteemed on account of their whiteness
and the thickness of their texture; a fifth quality, called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
scovazze, is entirely consumed on the island. The total export
of cotton in 1871 was 770,850 lbs.</p>

<p>During the time when the silk trade flourished, mulberry
trees were objects of most careful attention, and still abound
upon the island. The finest and whitest silk is now obtained
from the neighbourhood of Famagusta, and Karpasso; the
lemon, or sulphur-coloured, comes from Citereau, and most of
the northern villages, whilst that made about Baffo is of a
golden colour.</p>

<p>The Greek females of some of the towns and villages work
exquisite embroidery, and make a kind of silk net, which will
bear comparison with the finest European lace. On the west
side of the island the peasants distil rose, orange, and lavender
water, and myrtle and ladanum oil.</p>

<p>Amongst the birds, snipe, pheasants, partridges, quails,
and thrushes are very abundant, as are also most of the birds
of passage that make Africa their home during the winter.</p>

<p>Until the commencement of the seventeenth century
150,000 kilderkins of wine were annually produced; whilst
at the beginning of the present century, only a sixth part
of that quantity was made. The manufacture of wine has
considerably increased in the last few years, but principally
for foreign consumption. The lower order of Cypriotes find
their wine too strong for their heads, and too dear for their
pockets, and drink little or none. The taxes upon wine are
at present very heavy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span></p>

<p>The utilisation of the fruit of the island, as a means of profit
is now never thought of; even the celebrated vegetables of
Cyprus are now almost unknown, and the inhabitants content
themselves with gathering wild cresses, artichokes, purslane,
and asparagus. The olive-tree, however, as we have said, is
still largely grown, cultivated we cannot call it, as not only
the planting, but the gathering the fruit, and expressing the
oil, are carried on in the most careless manner. Without
the olive, however, sorry indeed would be the fare of the
Cypriotes.</p>

<p>Potatoes flourish in the mountainous districts and kolokasia
in low-lying regions. Melons, pumpkins, and gherkins are
also found in great profusion. During the last forty years,
Greek and French enterprise has made various efforts to bring
about a better state of things. What may not now be hoped
for when this luxuriant island is again under a paternal
dominion and the safety of individual rights secured?</p>

<p>At all times, snakes, which, however, are not dangerous,
tarantulas, and venomous spiders abounded in the island, and
Dr. Clarke gives a forcible description of its insect pests.
Speaking of the tarantula, he describes one species of about
an inch long, as having “a body of bright yellow, and beset
with long and prickly hairs. It runs with prodigious swiftness,
and thus more easily escapes its destruction, in which
mankind are interested; its bite being very dangerous, and its
venom very subtle. The parts which are attacked by it swell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
in an instant, and occasion excessive pain, followed by death
if certain remedies be not speedily applied.”</p>

<p>The cultivation of the sugar-cane is now quite unknown in
Cyprus, and the cotton-plant is only grown in a few districts.</p>

<p>It has been erroneously stated that the natives will not
touch the flesh of the ox, from the idea that it would be cruel
to eat the companion of their labours. Numerous small, but
fat cattle are fed on the plains, and their beef enjoyed as
much by the Cypriote as by an Englishman. Great numbers
of sheep and goats are also reared. The mutton is juicy and
tender.</p>

<small><small>ST. NICHOLAS AND LIMASOL.</small></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Whilst</span> I was in Kolossin I learnt that some fine marble
pillars, which lay outside in the court-yard, had been brought
from the Abbey of St. Nicholas, which was only some few
leagues off, upon the neighbouring peninsula. Everything
I heard of this interesting ruin made me more desirous of
inspecting it. Visions of European abbeys floated before my
eyes, and I determined to start at once to view this Cyprian
reality.</p>

<p>Next morning I sent on my dragoman and horse-boy to
Limasol, with orders to try and get lodgings for me in the
Franciscan cloisters, and then rode forward with Hussein on
the way to St. Nicholas. After about an hour and a half’s
hard riding, we reached the south portion of the peninsula.
The spot was a bare, open plain, and the water by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
it was surrounded, full of reeds. We had scarcely reached
our destination, than torrents of rain began to fall, and we
were forced to take shelter under a ruined wall, standing our
horses in front of us, to prevent our being literally washed
away. Happily, the storm was only of short duration, and
the ground was soon dry again, and we could continue our
investigations. The little church of St. Nicholas, which
was evidently built in the fifteenth century, is in good
condition, and stands in the midst of the ruined abbey, the
rectangular walls of which surround it. On closely examining
the church it was easy to trace the solid foundations of
the ancient temple, on the site of which it had been built.
Rows of broken pillars, some extending along the hinder
walls, indicated what had once been a covered walk for the
monks. Over the doorway was a huge marble tablet, on
which five coats-of-arms were chiselled. The ancient temple
which preceded the abbey had evidently been very extensive,
and I could trace its foundations for some feet beyond the
cloister walls. In one corner stood what had been an altar,
and near it a very deep cistern. The old walls here, which
are as hard as iron, had been taken in large masses to form,
evidently, the abbey walls. Marble pillars lay in all directions,
but I saw none as fine as the two that had attracted
my attention in the inn yard at Kolossin. No trace of the
abbey garden was left, beyond some olive-trees, the roots of
which were buried quite impartially under the ancient and
mediæval walls. A few goats were wandering about, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
gave a touch of animation to the melancholy and deserted
scene. The water about this peninsula is as rich in salt as is
that near Larnaka.</p>

<p>I mounted a neighbouring eminence, but could see no trace
of life. Not a ship, or boat, appeared upon the bosom of the
sea beyond, and I could not help asking myself, as I descended,
if this whole country was destined to remain desolate for ever,
or if we could hope that, under a new government, it might
attain fresh vitality, and again take its place as one of the
animated spots of the earth.</p>

<p>The road from the ruins of the temple and monastery
upon the southern peninsula, a distance of about three and
a half hours’ ride, winds around the salt marsh, and then
turns towards the sea. Limasol is more European in its appearance
than any other town in Cyprus. Houses built of
clay and stone predominate here, more especially in the part
inhabited by the Turks.</p>

<p>Clay and wood seem, at the present day, to be the favourite
building materials of these people, and it is the same wherever
they settle. Even a small party of Turkish women that
we encountered, were making a house exactly as in Smyrna
or Constantinople. When these women see a stranger approaching
at a distance, they cover themselves up, but as he
draws nearer, the pretty ones always draw their veils a little
aside, so that he may have a peep at their fresh, smiling faces.
This use of the veil appears general throughout Turkey, and
was practised even during the time of the Crusaders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span></p>

<p>We rode through a long street, and as we approached a
stately-looking house, Hussein called my attention to a flag
emblazoned with the German eagle, which floated over the
roof; with delight I recognised it, and read the familiar inscription.
I then rode on to the Franciscan convent, where
the little monk, who stood before the door, came forward to
receive me with every demonstration of joy and fatherly
welcome. Hardly had I refreshed myself with a cup of excellent
coffee, than he arose and insisted upon my following
him to my chamber and resting myself after my fatiguing
journey. He afterwards came to fetch me, in order that he
might show me over the convent. From the terrace we had
a noble prospect, looking towards the mountains which, although
bare, rose grandly above the surface of the plain.
Behind the garden, we found a little sequestered churchyard.
The small number of graves, indicated that during a long
period only two or three of the brotherhood had here found
their resting-place. It would seem that these monks had
been placed here, more to watch over the place, than for any
pastoral service. For the purposes of worship a new and
very beautiful church was in course of erection; the money
to build this had come from Rome, where gold is always
forthcoming to build churches with, in any part of the world
where Roman Catholics are to be found.</p>

<p>After we had returned to the dining-hall, there entered a
very smart merchant from Tyre, who, like myself, was a guest
in the convent. This man offered me a gem that he said he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
had just found, for which he asked an enormous price. He
was not at all abashed when I told him the value of the article
might possibly be a couple of piastres. The manufacture of
these pretended antiquities is carried on in Smyrna, Beyrut,
and Jerusalem on an extensive scale, and appears to be very
profitable.</p>

<p>And now the German consular agent appeared with his
cavass, dragoman, and staff of officers, to greet me on my
arrival, and when they departed, Hussien marched after them,
and thus they paraded about the town, and through the
bazaar. People are very fond of show and parade of this
description, a passion doubtless derived from the customs of
the Romans and Byzantines. The German resident in
Limasol seemed somewhat disappointed because we had
passed his house without calling, and urgently insisted on my
accompanying him home, where, he said, everything had been
prepared for my reception. The little priest, however, had
laid an embargo on my person, and declared that such an
affront should not be offered to his convent. The Italian
consul also paid me a visit, and also the master of the Greek
school, and I was highly amused, knowing, as I did, that all
these pressing invitations were given with the full knowledge
that the next steamer for Constantinople left Larnaka
in three days, and that there was no chance of my waiting a
whole week for the next. I then in company with the Greek
schoolmaster, took a walk through the town, and inspected
the bazaar, the schools, and the church. In the higher school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
there were about twenty scholars, in the lower upwards of
a hundred; their number increases rapidly from one half
year to another. Behind the school I noticed a column,
the capital of which was very handsome, and which I was
told had been brought from the monastery of St. Nicholas.
The interior of the town has a very European appearance; it
is, indeed, principally modern, and has been built—a good
augury for Cyprus—in consequence of the increased export
of wines grown in the country.</p>

<p>Limasol at the present day contains about six thousand inhabitants,
of whom one-third, and these the poorest, are Turks.
Among the Greek population there are already several well-to-do
merchants, who trade in flax and wool.</p>

<p>In the evening, a visit to our consular agent enabled me to
observe the domestic economy of the Cyprians, in a Greek
house of some pretensions. The agent himself is a young
man of polished address and very engaging manners, the
mistress of the house charmingly beautiful. There was also a
lady whose bright and sparkling eyes gleamed with intelligence
and persevering energy. Her family belonged to the oldest
nobility of the island, and yet had not been resident there
for more than a century and a half. Under Turkish rule
families do not easily attain to nobility or distinction. It
may also be remarked that of late years the higher Turkish
officials, who came from Constantinople, were seldom people of
such refined manners as their predecessors. How can it be
otherwise, seeing that money is now the only key whereby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
admission to office can be obtained? Even the multitude of
green-turbaned descendants of the Prophet, are quickly disappearing.
In China they manage better. After the
imperial family, ranks that of Kung-fu-tso (Confucius), and
there are about ten thousand living descendants of the sage—but
it is only the real lineal head of the family, the Prince
Kung, who is benefited by the renown of his ancestry. In
Turkey, on the contrary, the canker-worm has been long
devouring the whole ancestral tree, root and branch. The
curse of the country is, that dignity and work are thought to
be incompatible with each other, and the descendants of the
Prophet consider themselves too illustrious to do anything.</p>

<p>About ten o’clock we sat down to table, and our first glass
was dedicated to our country’s noble flag, which waved above
the roof of the house. At this time, however, there were few
Germans in Limasol, and during the whole year but two or
three German vessels had cast anchor in the roadstead.</p>

<p>I am, however, pretty well convinced that a good trade
might be established here, even if the cargoes consisted
entirely of wine. The conversation turned principally on the
population and revenue, and I succeeded in making a few
additions to my knowledge concerning the statistics of the
country. As regards the population of Cyprus, I was told
that the Turks numbered about 200,000, and Greeks 100,000.
An European observer, who was long a resident here,
reckoned 100,000 Greeks, 40,000 Turks, and 1000 Maronites
and Roman Catholics; most probably, however, if we estimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
the total at 150,000, of whom about a third are Turks, we
should not be far from the truth.</p>

<p>Equally at variance with each other were the accounts
that I received concerning the revenue, although my questions
were only put to persons who, <i>ex officio</i>, were able at least
to give approximate information. The revenue derived from
the customs and taxes, was estimated by one at thirty-five
millions of piastres, by another at thirty millions, and by a
third at twenty-four millions; the figures set down in the
following Table are, however, probably nearer the mark:</p>

<p>Truly, for a country so large, so luxurious, and so rich
(when we consider the small value of the piastre), this is but
a sorry income. From this, moreover, must be deducted the
cost of the mosques, Mohammedan schools, and other similar
institutions, which even in Cyprus are distributed over a con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>siderable
portion of the island. These are placed under the
superintendence of the Mohammedan priesthood, and there is
a proverb which says, “Sooner will the eyes of the dead shed
tears, than priests give up money.” In Cyprus it is well
understood that, of all these taxes, not above two or three
millions of piastres find their way to Constantinople; nay,
that the inhabitants have, in addition to these imposts, to pay
considerable sums to the Turkish officials to keep them in a
good humour. Moreover, the Turks are constantly obliged
to bribe one another, in order to keep themselves in office, and
to maintain the dignity of their position. The sums expended
upon roads, bridges, and public buildings, are of very trifling
amount. Even the cost of the military establishment is exceedingly
small. The population is too weak and too lazy to
require much of a garrison, and the Turks come willingly from
other places, to fulfil the military duties in so quiet a spot.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER XXVII<br /><br />
<small><small>AMATHUS.</small></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning we journeyed onwards towards Amathus.
The day was lovely, one of the most exquisite I have ever
experienced in any climate, and as we galloped along, my
veins seemed to dance with every breath I drew. At such
moments one readily comprehends why the inhabitants of
Cyprus have never taken any high place in the fields of
literature and art, and why its seductive and enervating air
has always proved attractive to the Turks, as it did formerly
to the ancient Romans. Our road lay through waving cornfields,
the rich golden hues of which were finely contrasted
with the deep blue waters of the sea, which in many places
reached the very borders of the fields. Suddenly a change
arose, the sun mounted high into the heavens, and beat down
upon us with such fiery force and fury, as caused me fully to
appreciate the appropriateness of the symbol stamped upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
ancient coins of Cyprus, namely, a devouring lion, backed, in
some instances, by an image of the sun’s rays. Terrible,
indeed, is the destruction worked by the ravening jaws of
Phœbus Apollo, upon the fruitful gardens and flowery
plains of this fertile island. At these seasons, only such fields
as lie close to the sea can resist the parching blight; in these
tracts on the shore, plants of all kind flourish luxuriantly,
drawing the moisture which supports them from the refreshing
dews borne to them from the neighbouring waves. In such of
these cultivated portions of the coast as also enjoy the moisture
brought by the smaller streams, as they discharge themselves
into the sea, the harvests and crops are still more luxuriant.
Not only the country near to Limasol, over which I was
now riding, but the coast about Episkopi, Kition, Larnaka,
Famagusta, besides the north coast near Morphu and
Lagathos, and other places, possess many of these most valuable
agricultural districts. Much land has already been
reclaimed for the purposes of cultivation, and there is no
reason why so successful an experiment should not be
attempted upon many other parts of the coast.</p>

<p>After about two hours’ riding, we reached what appeared
to me to be the ruins of a church, standing close to the shore,
and beside these a heap of ancient hewn stones, lying ready
to be shipped for Port Saïd, where they were to be employed
in the construction of a new harbour. On our left rose a
mountain, with fields of corn extending to a considerable
distance up its slopes. My dragoman was most desirous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
to ride on, without my lingering to investigate the spot, and
when I assured him that this mount was certainly the site of the
ancient Amathus, positively asserted that not a trace of anything
was to be seen. I believe the rascal was afraid he
should again get more climbing than suited his indolence, for
he declared in piteous accents that it would take us fully an
hour to reach the summit. By this time, however, I knew
the gentleman I had to deal with, and persisted in my
determination to make the attempt. Our road was certainly
of the steepest, but the way was short, and in about fifteen
minutes we were at the top. Much did I rejoice that I had
persevered in my own course, for before me lay the spot that I
had sought. The mount was indeed a natural fortress of the
first order, and must have afforded most secure refuse during
the disturbed periods of the island’s history. On the side
facing the sea, by which we had ascended, I could trace the
foundations of an ancient rampart. On the other three sides,
such protection had been quite unnecessary, as the rock rose
sheer, and almost perpendicularly from the fruitful valley at
its base. Here had once stood a large city, founded by the
Phœnicians, which is still called in Hebrew, Hamath, or the
fortified city. The building appears to have covered the
eminence, and from thence extended to the shores of the sea.
Tacitus, and other ancient writers, speak of Amathus as the
oldest city in Cyprus; at the present day, it may be described
as the one of which the traces have been most ruthlessly
destroyed. With the exception of the shattered pieces of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
gigantic vase, of which I shall speak presently, and the ruined
church upon the coast, no trace is left of its former greatness.
From the top of the mount to the very shores of the sea, every
sign has been removed, beyond that afforded by heaps of
broken stones and potsherds.</p>

<p>Twelve years ago, the last valuable was removed by French
antiquarians. This relic was one of two gigantic vases, finely
shaped in solid stone, with sides almost a foot in thickness, and
ornamented with four gracefully arched handles, decorated
with palm branches, and adorned upon its sides by the images of
four bulls. The interior of this delicately chiselled but gigantic
vase, was about ten feet in diameter, and so deep that an
ordinary man standing within could just have looked over its
edges. At the time this spot was visited by the French
travellers we speak of, one of these two precious relics stood
above ground, and was quite perfect, whilst the other was
partially buried in the earth. Disgraceful as it may appear,
the fact is certain, that when the French officers, who were
overlooking the removal of the perfect vase, found that its
companion, embedded in the earth, was somewhat in their way,
they at once ordered the sailors who were with them to smash
it to pieces. This fact was related to me by a gentleman of
high position in Limasol, who was an eye-witness of this act
of wanton destruction. My zaptieh, Hussein, it afterwards
appeared, had been present with his master, my friendly
pacha, whilst this monster vase was being pulled down the
mountain, and spoke with enthusiasm of its enormous size<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
and beauty. He also informed me that the French frigate,
“La Perdrix,” commanded by Comte de Vögue, had a small
steamship to assist in conveying the valuable relic. I found
pieces of a handle of the broken vase lying strewn about the
mountain.</p>

<p>For a thousand years, these giant mementos of a former
age had stood upon these mountains, to record the grandeur
of past ages, and would have remained untouched by the
wear and tear of centuries to come, had it not been for the
barbarous Vandalism of a handful of French officers. What
may have been the use of these magnificent vessels, is quite
uncertain; the oxen sculptured upon them would appear to
give them a religious significance, and we know that similar
vases stood without the Temple at Jerusalem. It is most
probable they were in some manner connected with the
numerous sacrifices that formed so large a part of the religious
ceremonies to Venus.</p>

<p>On these heights, the feasts in honour of Adonis were held.
This beautiful youth, the beloved of Venus, is said to have
met his death in the Idalion forest between Larnaka and
Famagusta, where, according to heathen mythology, he was
killed by a wild boar he had wounded. Anemones are said
to have sprung up from the ground that was moistened by his
blood. These feasts to Adonis, which were first celebrated
at Byblos, in Phœnicia, were afterwards introduced to Greece
and Cyprus. In the latter country they lasted eight days,
of which the first four were spent in howling and lamenting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
and the four last in joyful clamours, as if Adonis had
returned to life. The orgies, in connection with these feasts,
were immoral in the extreme, and we are told that Pygmalion,
the celebrated statuary of Cyprus, was so disgusted
by the profligacy of the women of Amathus, that he resolved
never to marry. The affection he had denied to the other
sex, he, therefore, liberally poured forth upon the creation
of his own hands. He became enamoured of a beautiful
marble statue he had made, and at his earnest request and
prayers, the Goddess of Love changed the favourite statue
into a woman, whom the artist married, and by whom he
had a son named Paphos, who founded the city of that name
in Cyprus.</p>

<p>The ascent of Amathus would well repay any one who
would attempt it, if only for the magnificent view presented
from its summit. On one side lies a broad expanse of blue
sea, and on the other a semicircle of dark heights and peaks,
whilst between the two extends the gay and luxuriant valley,
stretching its fruitful fields and gardens to the shore.</p>

<p>“Under the Ptolemies,” says Cesnola, “and in the later
history of Cyprus, Amathus appears to have lost the ancient
importance which it enjoyed, when ruled by its own kings,
and when its natural allies, the Persians, were all-powerful.”</p>

<p>“On the hill on which it stood nothing is now visible but a
vast amount of stones, plaster, and broken pottery. Even
the hill itself is fast losing its form, while the rock of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
it is composed is being cut away, to be shipped at Port Saïd,
bringing to the merchants of Limasol a profitable return.
From the great amount of <i>débris</i> which covers the surrounding
fields, for the most part untilled, Amathus, it would seem,
though small in area, must have been a thickly populated
city. Originally the upper part of the hill had been encircled
by a wall, remains of which are now scarcely perceptible;
portions, however, of another wall of a later period may
especially be observed on the southern side looking towards
the sea, and following the sinuous windings of the hill. I
found imbedded in this wall pieces of terra-cotta jars and
fragments of granite columns, which had been used as building
materials. On the southern side, portions of it ran as
far as the shore. It is probable that the square built ruin, at
the southern end of the hill, formed a gateway, since, between
the city and the sea-shore, there was, and still is, the high
road to Paphos. On the crest of this hill I dug at several
places, until I came to the solid rock, but failed to discover
any sculptured remains of importance. I found, however,
sufficient evidence to convince me that most of the building
materials of what I call the Phœnician city, had been used
for the construction of the later Greek buildings.”</p>

<p>“Amathus, when subsequently inhabited by a Greek population,
spread itself in a more south-easterly direction, and
nearer to the sea-shore, protected by the second wall, which I
spoke of, and though at the time of its destruction by King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
Richard of England, it was still the seat of the last Duke of
Cyprus, Isaac Comnenas, it had already lost most of its
splendour and importance.”</p>

<p>“It was on the top of this hill, that M. de Vögue discovered
the large stone vase which is now deposited in the museum of
the Louvre. Near the same spot, there are fragments of what
seems to have been a similar vase. In the immediate vicinity
of the site where these vases were found, I dug up, on a
former excursion, three large shafts of columns, of a hard
bluish stone, resembling granite. I left them half-buried in
the soil, with the intention of examining them on a future
occasion; but when I returned, the columns had disappeared,
having been broken up for building purposes. There are
thousands of stones on the top and sides of this hill, which
would equally well suit the purposes of these workmen, but
it seems that they are possessed by some infatuation or evil
mania for destroying whatever bears the traces of man’s
handicraft. It is the more to be regretted, since among the
ruins very few architectural or sculptured remains are now
found.”</p>

<p>Far away in the distance, is the town of Limasol, washed
by the waters of its beautiful and rounded bay, behind this
again a long line of coast, and then the eye just discerns the
promontory of Curias, stretching its length far into the sea,
where it terminates in Capo delle Gatte. Cesnola gives an
amusing account of the origin of this name, which is too
interesting to be omitted. “On one occasion,” he says, “my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
mule was terrified by a sudden leap from a bush, of what
appeared to me to be a cat; my guide assured me that both
at this cape, and near to Acrotiri, there are wild cats, which
hunt and destroy the asps abounding there. I at once
recollected having read that the ‘Caloyers’ of the convent
of Acrotiri raised and trained a superior breed of cats,
which they imported from Constantinople, to kill the asps in
their neighbourhood. That at the tolling of a particular bell
in the convent, these cats would come in to be fed twice
a day, and then return to their work of destruction. I
suppose that it is called Capo delle Gatte in reference to these
cats.”</p>

<p>When we had descended the mountain and were once
more on the shore, I observed a number of black and half-black
Egyptian sailors, all in rags, who were busily employed
in carrying stones to their ships which were anchored in the
roads. Their captain looked on, smoking his pipe, and
shaded from the sun by a small tent. Stones from the oldest
city in Cyprus, going over to Port Saïd, to help in the
construction of the newest town on the opposite continent,
near which a harbour is in course of construction, destined
to receive the ships coming from every quarter of the globe;
whilst here at my feet lay the ancient harbour of Amathus,
of which nothing remains but its natural basin, formed by
rocks which extend some distance into the sea.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER XXVIII<br /><br />
<small><small>KARUBIEH AND MAZOTOS.</small></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we left Amathus, our road lay over a barren mountainous
tract, entirely destitute of every charm, but as we
reached Cape Karubieh, a scene of great beauty opened up
from the left to our view. Before us lay a little town,
looking as fresh and bright as if but quite recently built,
with houses that appeared much more stately and substantial
than any I had yet seen in Cyprus. To our surprise these
attractive-looking residences were closed and untenanted, and
not a human creature was to be seen, except a solitary negro
at a small inn where we got a cup of coffee. I afterwards
learnt that the inhabitants of Karubieh, which number
about one thousand only, return to their homes in August.
At this season many ships anchor here to take in large
cargoes of fruit for Trieste, Marseilles, Smyrna, Odessa, and
St. Petersburg. The fields, from which all this superabundant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
harvest is produced, cover all the declivities of the sea-shore
from Limasol to Mazotos. The once despised carob-tree
(Ceratonia siliqua) is now much esteemed, and the fruit,
which was formerly only used either as food for cattle, or
occasionally eaten during seasons of fasting, has become of
great value. Of late years it has been discovered that the
fruit is highly valuable for the making of excellent brandy,
and the tree is therefore cultivated throughout this district
with the utmost assiduity. About April the branches are
lopped off; numerous shoots from fruitful trees are grafted
on the trunks, and in a very short space of time the tree is
covered with succulent pods. I mention this interesting fact,
to prove of what this once fertile island is capable, when its
products receive the necessary attention. In this instance,
as in many others, gold is literally lying on the ground in
Cyprus, ready to be picked up by those who have enterprise
and energy.</p>

<p>Our road from Cape Karubieh presented nothing of
interest. The mountains gradually receded inland, and the
eye found nothing to relieve the monotony of the bare expanse
of coast, until at length our further progress in a direct
line was stopped by a rocky promontory, which projected far
into the sea. We were now obliged to turn inland, and soon
reached higher ground, from whence we once more obtained
a good view of the purple and deep blue mountains, and
could see their tints gradually deepen under the shadow of
approaching night. It was late before we reached Mazotos,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
and I at once endeavoured to obtain a lodging, in the house
of some well-to-do farmer, from whom I might hope to learn
many interesting particulars concerning the manners and
customs of the people. As we entered the town, I observed
a court-yard leading from a stable to a small house within.
At the left-hand side was a flight of stone steps, conducting
to an upper chamber, which, it being harvest time, was now
filled with corn.</p>

<p>Opposite this was the large roomy apartment, that served
for living and sleeping room to the whole family. The floor
was covered with tiles, and the room divided in the centre by
an arch. A stone ledge of imposing appearance projected
from one of the walls, and was well garnished with household
utensils, whilst upon the whitewashed walls, hung the
clothes, nets, hammocks, and long baskets belonging to the
family. Large pitchers of red clay, and numerous calabashes,
stood about, filled with bread, eggs, fruit, maize, and vegetables.
The kitchen was outside in the yard, and I could not
avoid noticing the cheerful alacrity and skill displayed by
our worthy hostess, whilst she prepared our evening meal.
Servants she had none, everything in the interior of the
house being done by the members of the family, whilst out
of doors they were assisted about the farm and garden by
day labourers. In Cyprus, the soil is so light that a farmer
will readily plough over thirty acres of ground with one
yoke of oxen, and see his land reward his labours by bringing
forth its fruits thirty fold. The processes of sowing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
reaping are equally carelessly performed, and when this is
over, but few farmers touch the fields again. For this reason,
without a farmer has really extensive property, he does not
incur the expense of board and wages to regular men. During
the harvest time a day labourer receives three shillings a day
and three meals. Should a farmer not be inclined to comply
with their demands, he will stand, as with us, a very good
chance of having his corn spoilt, before he can get it into
his barns. At other seasons the men cannot obtain more
than from elevenpence to one shilling and threepence, and
the women from about fivepence to eightpence per day.
Small as is the sum, it amply suffices to provide all that the
lower class Cypriotes require, sleeping as they do for nine
months of the year in the open air. Food, such as they principally
consume, is extremely cheap, and we have it upon
the authority of a gentleman who knows the island well,
Consul Lang, that a family of six persons can be maintained
in perfect health and activity on an allowance of forty
pounds of flour and three pounds of olives per week. In
ordinary seasons the cost of this quantity of provisions would
not exceed three shillings and sixpence. Cesnola mentions
that he has frequently seen Greek priests in Cyprus working
in the fields like common peasants.</p>

<p>Contrary to all my experience in Cyprus, when we quitted
the farmer’s house, the worthy host at once complied with my
request, that he would make some charge for our accommodation.
This I accounted for by the fact, that the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
standing on the highway between Limasol and Larnaka, would
probably attract the attention of more strangers than could be
comfortably entertained without proper remuneration. A
present to the poor, if your resting-place has been a convent,
or a little remembrance to the children of a family, is the most
that is expected throughout all those parts of the East through
which I have travelled, whilst should your entertainer be a
man of position and means, you cannot, without giving offence,
do more than offer a “pour boire” to the four or five men-servants
who will appear at the door to see you start.</p>

<p>Our last day’s journey, which was short but delightful, lay
over a wide tract of cornfields, in traversing which we passed
the village of Kiti, with its little church, embowered in fruit
trees, and not far from it another church standing on a piece
of barren ground, without a shrub or tree near it. On our
left towered a magnificent mountain, which rises abruptly to
a height of two thousand feet, and bears upon its summit
the once celebrated monastery of the Holy Cross, or Hagios
Stavros. This building, which is rarely or never obscured by
clouds or fog, can be seen from a considerable distance at
sea, and has long been known to sailors as a landmark. St.
Helena is supposed to have presented this cloister with a
valuable relic, which brought many pilgrims and gifts to the
brotherhood. This was a piece of wood, about as long as a
finger, fashioned like a cross, mounted in silver, and had the
reputation of being a veritable portion of the Saviour’s cross.</p>

<p>Whilst it was still light, we came in sight of Larnaka, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
cornfields were crowded with labourers gathering in the
harvest, and these, being principally Greeks, and therefore
very conversational, we could hear a lively hum of many
voices long before we reached the spot. We dined under
the shadow of a large fig-tree, which grew upon the brink of
a rippling stream. Numerous cranes, and whole hosts of
beccaficos, came within such tempting reach of our guns,
that, as soon as our repast was over, we started after them, over
fields where horses and camels were grazing, and over marshy
ground, until we reached the rolling, glittering sea. Our
sport was excellent, for my dragoman knew every call and
wile by which the birds could be allured, and it required some
determination when it was time to return, to quit our delightful
but peculiar shooting-ground.</p>

<p>On my return to Larnaka I had the luck to chance upon
some dear friends, with whom I supped. Our host produced
the best his cellar contained, in various sorts of wine, winding
up with a bottle fifty years old, most delicious, but so strong
that discretion only permitted us to taste it in thimblefuls.</p>

<p>Next day I paid many visits in the town, and was amused
to find with what astonishment the history of my little
journey across the island was received. I really believe that
at that time there was not a single person in the island who
had seen as much of Cyprus as myself.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER XXIX<br /><br />
<small>LAST DAYS IN LARNAKA.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> my eagerness to obtain all possible information, concerning
the manners and customs of the people, I had often to
encounter much disappointment. Imagine my disgust upon
one occasion, when, having heard that a very rare and charming
performance was about to take place, and having hurried
to the spot indicated, a little coffee-house, I found the anticipated
treat was nothing more nor less than the clumsy
antics of a half-naked negress, probably a new arrival from
Egypt, who was performing one of the hideous dances of
which I had already seen too much. A few Turks sat
around, watching her contortions and tremblings with unruffled
dignity, and amongst the spectators I noticed some
really respectable-looking Greeks. I speedily left the assembly,
and reflected as I retired, as to whether this species
of dance, might not have been the very kind performed, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
in more graceful fashion, by the worshippers of Aphrodite, in
the sacred groves that surrounded her temples. The next
day was the feast of St. George the Martyr, which is regarded
as a political as well as a religious celebration by the numerous
Grecians in the island. This day is chosen as being the
fête of King George of Greece, who they still regard as their
lawful head.</p>

<p>It cannot but be regarded as a most strange coincidence,
that the tutelar saint of England and her new possession,
should be one and the same. St. George was regarded by
several Eastern nations as their patron, and ancient Byzantine
historians relate accounts of many battles gained, and miracles
wrought, by his intercession. Among other churches, five
or six were dedicated to him at Constantinople. He was also
celebrated in France in the sixth century, and is said to have
been chosen as the patron saint of England under her
Norman kings. St. George of Cappodocia, “Martyr and
Victor,” as he is sometimes styled, one of the seven
champions of Christendom, was, no doubt, brought into connection
with Cyprus, under the influence of Richard and
his knights.</p>

<p>The legend of the saint is as follows: St. George, who
was born in Cappadocia, went with his mother to Palestine,
of which country she was a native, and where she had considerable
estates. These fell to her son, who was a soldier,
and became a tribune, and was further promoted by the
Emperor Diocletian, to whom, however, he resigned his com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>mission
when that emperor made war against the Christian religion.
He was thrown into prison for remonstrating against
bloody edicts, and was afterwards beheaded at Nicomedia.
St. George became the patron of the soldiers who fought
for the faith, and his apparition is said to have encouraged
the Christian army in the Holy War, before the battle of
Antioch, which proved fortunate under Godfrey of Bouillon,
and he is also said to have appeared and inspirited Richard
Cœur de Lion, in his expedition against the Saracens. St.
George is usually represented in pictures as on horseback,
slaying a dragon; but this is no more than an emblematical
figure, purporting that by his faith and Christian fortitude, he
had overcome the devil.</p>

<p>The great majority of the population of Larnaka, as of
the rest of the island, are members of the Greek Church.</p>

<p>The chief points of difference between the Greek Church
and that of Rome, are the following:</p>

<p>The Greek Church does not admit: First. The supremacy
of Rome.</p>

<p>Secondly. The Filioque clause in the creed.</p>

<p>Thirdly. The enforced celibacy of the parochial clergy
(the reason of this being that although the monastic system had
begun before the schism, the celibacy of the regular clergy
had not been enforced till a later period, and this was adopted
by the Greek Church).</p>

<p>Fourthly. The doctrine of transubstantiation, in the Papal
sense of that term, is not held by the Greek Church; (Rome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
itself did not adopt this strange tenet till the Council of
Lateran in 1215).</p>

<p>Fifthly. The dogmas of purgatory and penance, as taught
by Rome, are not held by the Greek Church, yet some
of their views bear a close resemblance to the papal theories
on these points.</p>

<p>Sixthly. The Greek Church disagrees with that of Rome
about the use of leaven in the Eucharist. In almost all
other respects there is little difference between the churches.
The Greek Church is thoroughly hierarchical, holds the monastic
system, worships pictures (although it rejects the
worship of images), and gives to the Virgin Mary as high
a degree of worship as even Rome can do; its theory of the
Panagia being scarcely distinguishable from that of the Immaculate
Conception.</p>

<p>The officiating clergy of the Greek Church are the
patriarch, archbishops, and bishops; subordinate to these are
the papades or parish priests. All the dignitaries are taken
from among the caloyers or monastic orders, and are not
allowed to marry, but the papades may be married, with these
special limitations: That they are married previous to their
consecration, and may not marry a second time, should they
become widowers. Hence they are commonly married before
taking orders, and invariably select young and healthy women
for their wives. The revenues of the dignitaries are raised
by a tax imposed on each family, while the parish priests are
supported, chiefly by means of what they can obtain from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
superstitions of the people, and perquisites of office, such as
money paid for absolutions, benedictions, exorcism, ceremonial
sanctifying of water, sprinklings of streets and tombs,
granting divorces, and innumerable ritualistic observances.
They are almost universally a base and degraded class, themselves
extremely ignorant, and they keep the people in equal
degradation and ignorance, partly because such is their
own state, and partly that they may secure their own influence.
Their places of worship are built generally in form of a cross.
The choir is always placed towards the east, and the people
turn their faces in that direction when they pray. Their
public religious service is liturgical, and exceedingly protracted.
They have four liturgies, and the service consists
chiefly of prayers, hymns, recitations, chants, and frequent
crossings, with such numerous repetitions that it often occupies
five or six hours, without any sermon.</p>

<p>During this long service, the people stand, leaning on the
supports of the few seats in the church, or on a kind of
crutches, provided for the purpose. No images are allowed
within their churches, but they are plentifully decorated with
rough and glaring paintings; the more rough and glaring
these are, the higher they stand in the estimation of the
worshippers. Their music is without any aid from instruments,
and is chiefly a kind of chanting, but it is said to be
often beautiful and touchingly plaintive, although monotonous.
The vestments of the clergy are very varied in form, often of
fine texture, gorgeous in colour, and ornamented with jewellery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
of great value. Each of these vestments has its mystic meaning
and virtue, to which great importance is attached. The
worship of saints, angels, and the Virgin Mary, is carried to
as great an excess as it can be at Rome, and it is long since
the Greek Church held, that “the Mother of God” as they
term her, “was without original.” It may be said, indeed,
that the <i>Panagia</i>, or Holy Virgin, is the peculiar deity of the
Greeks, as much as ever Pallas Athene was of the ancient
Athenians. Everywhere, in church, palace, or cottage, a
little coarse picture intended to represent the Holy Virgin,
may be seen, often with a lamp burning before it, as the
object of special adoration.</p>

<p>Being desirous of seeing something of the festivities of the
Cypriotes on their fête day, I walked out to a church about half
a league from the “Marina,” and in spite of the scenery around
me, could have fancied I was again witnessing one of the
annual markets, I had seen as a boy in my native land.
Around and about the church, booths were ranged, and
peasants were wandering around, chatting and eagerly driving
bargains, under an impression very prevalent amongst them,
that there will not be the usual deceit and roguery so near
a house of God. Bells were pealing, and horses and asses
neighing and winnying, as their owners, dressed in their Sunday
best, galloped about in all directions. All those of the better
class who appeared on the occasion, were also mounted, the
elders looking on in stately dignity, whilst the youngsters
galloped hither and thither like the wind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span></p>

<p>In such a gathering as this in Central Europe, one would,
no doubt, see many more powerful men, and more blooming
girls, than are to be met with under similar circumstances in
Cyprus. And as I gazed at the crowds before me, I could
not help again noticing the strange blending of Syrian
and Grecian types, in the faces and figures, whilst the
dress of most was a curious mixture of European, Grecian,
and Turkish fashions. Many of the girls were remarkably
beautiful, with magnificent large flashing eyes; in most cases
their eyebrows were blackened, and their hair, mixed with
false, was piled high on the head. Not a few, as it appeared
to me, had dipped pretty deeply into pots of cosmetics, for
the use and compounding of which the fair Cypriotes have
long been noted. One fashion pleased me much—namely,
the common use of natural flowers for decorating the
head. The very poorest in the crowd wore some kind of
metal ornaments, whilst the wealthier class of women displayed
ear-rings, chains, and medallions of heavy gold. The
Cypriote husband takes great pride in seeing his wife thus
decked, not perhaps so much from sentimental reasons, as
because the extent of the show demonstrates what is the
depth of his cash-box, and the chances of his family in the
matter of dowries. For a Cypriote to invest his earnings in
land would, under the late Government, have been an
act involving the utmost risk of capital.</p>

<p>As I returned home on this my last day in Cyprus, I could
not but feel a shade of melancholy stealing over me. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
evening was lovely, the air pure and clear, and the sun as it
went down, tipped the purple mountains with gold, and gave a
tinge of bronze to the palms and cypress trees of Larnaka, as
they stood clearly defined against the evening sky.</p>

<p>When I reached the town, old and young were sitting
before the doors of the Grecian houses, or chatting and
laughing with each other in lively groups about the streets.
In the Turkish quarters, on the contrary, not a living creature
was visible, and every house had the appearance of being a
dungeon. Yet, as I have before said, could I have looked
within the high walls, I should probably have seen the entire
family enjoying the fragrant coolness of their gardens.</p>

<p>Next day, I bade farewell to this lovely island, which still
lay bound hand and foot, in the power of her negligent and
cruel masters, and entirely unconscious of the great and important
change that would shortly burst her bonds.</p>

<p>May we not trust that under British rule, her barren wastes
and plains may once more speedily become fruitful fields,
and her people again reap the blessings and benefits of a
pure Christian Church, and a paternal Government.</p>

<small><small>EFFORTS OF THE GERMANS TO OBTAIN CYPRUS.</small></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">So</span> much attention has lately been called to the concluding
chapters of Herr von Löher’s most interesting work, that we
feel compelled to present them, in an English form, even at
the risk of incurring blame in some quarters, for unnecessary
repetition. Throughout the whole of his travels in the island,
our author, shocked at the scenes of neglect and mismanagement
presented to his eyes, was constantly indulging in reflections
on what a different fate might await its inhabitants
could they be annexed to the mighty empire of his fatherland.
Indulging in this strain of thought, he presents us with a
lengthy account of what was done there by his countrymen in
former days.</p>

<p>In a short and rapid sketch of these pages, we will endeavour
to give only such details, as may be new and interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
to our readers, and suppressing as far as possible all such
matter as has already appeared in the body of the work.
Long after the Crusaders had been expelled from the Holy
Land, says Löher, they still retained the fortresses of Jaffa,
Akkon, Tyre, Sidon, Beyrut, Cæsarea, Antioch, Tripoli, and
other strongholds, the governors of which ruled over, and gave
commands to, a multitude of knights and people there resident.
The Christian forces, then dispersed over all Syria, should
have united under the imperial leadership, and opposed their
serried ranks to the forces of the Crescent. This was manifestly
the plan of the second Frederick, Emperor of Germany,
whose idea was, to put the Christian forces under the command
of Hermann von Salza, the renowned Preceptor of the
German order. This was he, who, in a conference at Ferentino,
at which the Pope, the Emperor, and King John of
Jerusalem were present, proposed that Frederick should marry
Isabella, the daughter of the last-mentioned sovereign, and
thus ally her inheritance, the kingdom of Jerusalem, with his
possessions, whilst her father should merely have the honour
of being nominally a king. The proposal was received joyfully
by all parties. The imperial marriage took place in the
year 1225, at Brindisi, where the bride’s father surrendered
the sceptre of Jerusalem into the hands of his new son-in-law—not,
however, without compulsion. Frederick forthwith
received the homage of all present, and sent a herald
with three hundred knights to the Holy Land, to ratify and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
complete the homage paid to the emperor—who, if he intended
to bring the crusade to a successful end, must necessarily
be the legitimate lord of the soil.</p>

<p>The Cyprians, however, thought that Frederick, after a
time, would be in a position to assume the feudal sovereignty
of their island, for the kingdom had in former times been
an appanage of the Emperor Heinrich the Sixth, his grandfather.
The late King Hugo the First had been for ten
years engaged in the crusade, and when he died, his only son,
the heir to the throne, was but nine months old.</p>

<p>The Emperor Frederick the Second at length discovered,
how powerless he was to remodel the affairs of the East. The
knights and merchants had ordered matters according to
their own pleasure. The barons with their feudal retainers
occupied their castles in perfect independence; the king was
only their leader, and the feudal parliament the court in
which they decided everything according to their pleasure.
With these uncontrolled nobles we must rank three orders
of knights, forming as many well-established and wealthy
brotherhoods, in which the military and monkish characteristics
were united. These ecclesiastical warriors were armed in
complete steel, and claimed princely prerogatives. In the
towns were guilds and corporations, combinations of merchants
and men of business, who watched over their own interests,
and resisted the innovations of the arrogant nobility. Among
all these petty powers, who were incessantly quarrelling among
themselves, Frederick found it a difficult task to introduce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
harmony, and harder still to bring them to acquiesce in his
authority.</p>

<p>Frederick had already proclaimed in Ferentino, that the
conquest of the Holy Land should no longer be carried on
in the name of the knights, but of the king only, thus intimating,
that the whole of it should belong to himself. In
Cyprus, matters were arranged upon a very different basis;
here the supreme authority was shared among the barons, and
the power of the king jealously circumscribed.</p>

<p>So long as the authority of the emperor was maintained
in Cyprus, he held the key of all the opposite coasts of Syria,
Asia Minor, and Egypt, and consequently, to possess the
sovereign power in this island, was from first to last the great
object of Oriental policy. In 1218 the last King of Cyprus
died, having on his death-bed appointed his wife, Alice,
regent. The knights, unwilling to submit to the authority of
a woman, compelled her to share her rule in the island with
Philip of Ibelin as co-regent. Meanwhile feuds sprang up on
all sides, and every occurrence seemed to increase the discord.
The Franks in the East had been vitiated by Byzantine
manners, and fought each other with the bitterest hatred,
quite unmindful of their original mission, which was to deliver
the Holy Land from the heathen. Quarrels soon arose
between the Latin and Greek Churches, and Cyprus became
the arena where bloody combats took place.</p>

<p>Frederick now entered the capital of Cyprus, and there
all the princes and barons interceded for Ibelin, who declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
that he and all his followers were ready to submit to the
emperor, and atone for their delinquencies. The emperor
did not seek revenge, but simple justice; and was extremely
desirous of securing the support of Cyprus, and the wealth
obtainable from that source, and thus the affair was soon
arranged; the barons, under the emperor’s command, acquiesced,
and a general amnesty was proclaimed upon the
following terms:</p>

<p>The emperor was to be the sole guardian of the young
king until he completed his twenty-fifth year. The government
of Cyprus and its revenues should be placed in the
hands of the emperor, and all the fortified places in the
kingdom delivered up to him. All the Cyprian knights who
had not sworn fealty to the emperor should immediately take
the oath of allegiance. Ibelin, in behalf of the ruler of
Beyrut, recognised the emperor as King of Jerusalem, and
did homage to him under that title, and agreed that all claims,
relative to the castle of Beyrut, should be settled by the
court of Jerusalem, and an account of all revenues due, since
the death of King Hugo, should be laid before the court of
Cyprus. The hostages demanded by the emperor were set at
liberty. Ibelin and all the Cyprian barons, with their followers,
were to accompany Frederick to the Holy Land, and
serve him there till the end of the crusade.</p>

<p>All these conditions were punctually carried out, the oath
of allegiance administered, and the castles, as well as the
revenue, given up. The emperor had achieved a complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
victory. Cyprus remained for several years under his command,
and its king was formally declared a prince of the
German empire. The emperor next appointed revenue officers
and treasurers, in all the castles and bailiwicks of the island,
and made arrangements that the money thus raised should be
sent after him into Syria. To these offices, as well as in garrisoning
the castles, the emperor appointed his own knights
by preference, and these gladly accepted such desirable
appointments.</p>

<p>After all these things were arranged, the emperor came to
Famagusta, and the next day, the 2nd of September, seven
weeks after his landing in Cyprus, embarked, taking the
young king with him, and accompanied by all the chivalry
of the island. Their landing was effected at Beyrut, Sidon,
Sarepta, and Tyre, as Frederick was desirous of becoming
more intimately acquainted with the coast of Syria; he probably
likewise intended that the armies of the Crusaders,
employed upon the fortifications of Sidon and of Cæsarea,
should enter Akkon while he remained upon the coast. In
the last-mentioned city, the most populous and the most important
in the Holy Land, the emperor was received with
great ceremony. The Crusaders, more especially those from
Germany, were jubilant; the clergy sang hymns of praise;
the Templars and the Knights of St. John did homage to
their sovereign, by kneeling before him and kissing his knees,
according to the custom of the times. Nevertheless Frederick
was well aware that, to use the words of an old writer, he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
in a land where neither God nor man had ever yet found
truth or loyalty.</p>

<p>The truth of this he soon found out. The Cyprians formed
by far the greater part of the host of Eastern warriors, led by
the high marshal Felingher, but the number of these was not
more than two thousand. Rome had already taken her precautions.
A Papal bull was issued denouncing Frederick,
and he was placed under an interdict. Messages both from
the Pope and the Patriarch warned the knights not to obey
the emperor’s commands, and it was promulgated amongst
the soldiery, that Frederick was under the curse of God, and
of the Church, and that all his acts were of no effect. Multitudes
of the Crusaders, despairing of the success of their
undertaking, deserted. The Knights of the Temple and of
St. John fell away from the emperor’s standard, and the rest
of the warriors of the Cross refused to be led to battle. The
Cyprian barons began to discuss the question whether the
oath they had taken to Frederick, was not overridden by the
feudal allegiance they owed to their king.</p>

<p>The Germans who had come over with the emperor under
the command of their leader, Hermann von Salza, kept their
plighted faith, and were the only supporters of the imperial
authority: these, however, taking them all together, knights
and squires, soldiers from Germany, Sicily, and Lombardy,
hardly amounted to twelve thousand men. With so feeble
an army—with the Eastern knights partly at open enmity,
partly vacillating, with the clergy altogether inimical—it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
quite impossible for Frederick to think of giving battle to the
unbelievers. He established himself in a camp near Akkon,
and while he strengthened the defences of Joppa, gave all
his attention to the establishment of a secret understanding
with the Sultan. Overtures to this effect had in truth been
already made by him from Italy, and during his stay in
Cyprus had been still further advanced.</p>

<p>Immediately on his arrival in the Holy Land it became
clear what were the necessities of his position, and what there
might be a possibility of his obtaining. The possession of
the holy places; a free pass for pilgrims in Syria and Palestine,
who must necessarily be under Christian jurisdiction; peace
secured by the strength of the fortress and the solemn oath of
the Mussulmans; all these were secured. Jerusalem, which,
for nearly half a century had been in their hands, was, with
the surrounding country, again placed in the power of the
Christians, who held, moreover, Bethlehem and the intervening
land. Joppa and a strip of country between that town
and Jerusalem; Nazareth and the road from thence to Akkon;
the fertile plain of Sidon; and in its neighbourhood the castle
Turon, commanding the entire coast; all these castles and
towns were permitted to be again fortified, and on the other
side the Sultan promised that he would raise no new fortifications.
All Christian prisoners, some of whom had been a
long while in the hands of the Mussulmans, were to be set free.
This peace was to last during ten years. All these arrange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>ments
were to be confirmed by the solemn oaths of both the
contracting parties.</p>

<p>When the terms of this peace became known in Joppa,
great joy was manifested by the Christians who accompanied
the emperor to Jerusalem, where, on the day of his arrival
(March 18, 1229), he offered up thanks in the church of the
Holy Sepulchre. After this, approaching the high altar, he
placed the crown of Jerusalem upon his head, and then
returned to his place. No priest was allowed to take part in
the rejoicings, which included festivities of every description.
Their general, Hermann von Salza, read before all the
soldiers and common people a manifesto by the emperor, explaining
why he had not been able to come before, and telling
them that the Pope had been compelled to publish his bann
by pressure of circumstances, and that everything should now
be arranged to secure peace among the heads of Christendom.
Next day the Patriarch of Jerusalem assailed him with
the Papal interdict. Frederick, in order to give no pretence
for suppressing public worship, returned to Joppa, and from
thence to Akkon.</p>

<p>Here the emperor remained for about five weeks, doing
everything which his position allowed to make peace with
the adherents of the Pope, at the head of whom stood the
Patriarch of Jerusalem. The patriarch, however, found him,
to use his own expression, “unhealthy from the crown of his
head to the sole of his foot,” and seemed rather exasperated
than otherwise at all the good that Frederick had achieved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
in so short a time. The proud Templars and Knights of St.
John, were furious because the chief control lay no longer with
them, but with the Germans. Even the ecclesiastics were
principally from France, very few of them from Italy.
Probably at no period of the world’s history has a body of
men existed so steeped in pride, so full of haughtiness, luxury,
and immorality, as the Templars. Well might they think that
in his heart the emperor had the intention of expelling them
from the Holy Land. The governors of the towns had instructions
to watch them strictly, and from his first arrival in Syria,
the emperor had endeavoured to give the ascendancy to his
German followers, while he scarcely concealed his design of
making the huge possessions of the Templars and Knights of
Jerusalem subservient to the worship of Christ, instead of
ministering to their insatiable debaucheries.</p>

<p>No wonder, therefore, that the burning hatred of the
Templars was aroused. Were it now possible to trace out all
their conspiracies against the life of Frederick, we should indeed
have to deal with a tangled web, while the enmity of the
Pope still further increased the dangers that surrounded him.
The whole land was filled with the Papal troops, whose
business was to plunder and to destroy, so that all the energies
of the emperor were put in requisition to govern and defend
the unhappy country. Balian of Sidon, a man universally
respected, a nephew of Idelin and Walter d’Allemand,
who deeply reverenced the Church, were appointed chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
governors, and all fortified places received efficient garrisons
and abundant supplies of provisions.</p>

<p>Above everything else, Frederick had in his mind the
kingdom of Cyprus. That rich island must now furnish
him with money to pay his officials in the Holy Land, and to
supply his army with provisions and warlike stores. The
kingdom of Jerusalem was no longer in a condition to pay
the heavy costs; it now indeed consisted only of a few
straggling towns, and a narrow strip of the sea-coast of
Syria. Cyprus had already been made to pay considerable
sums, which had been forwarded to the emperor, and in addition
to these, the Archbishop of Nikosia found himself compelled
to contribute largely; and now, before taking their
departure for Akkon, came Amalrich von Balas, Hugo von
Giblet, Gavain von Chenichy, and Wilhelm von Rivet, all
belonging to the highest nobility in Cyprus, who had all of
them conspired against Ibelin, and so represented him to the
emperor, that he was deprived of his lordship. Undoubtedly
they had all been sent for by the emperor himself, who
thought that the best way to insure the safety of the island,
was to put it into the hands of his most trusty friends, under
the auspices of the young king. These five noblemen were
instructed to form a regency, which should continue for three
years, during which time they were to protect and govern
the country, and to send over year by year ten thousand
marks to be paid directly into the hands of Balian and Werner
in Syria.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span></p>

<p>And now, after these arrangements, the emperor thought
himself secure, and hoped that at least for a few years he
should be able, not only to hold Cyprus, but also to defend
his little kingdom of Jerusalem. At the end of that time
he trusted that the people would have become accustomed to
his government, or that at least he should be able to return
with a greater force and more freedom of action.</p>

<p>That Frederick did accomplish a great and good work in
the Holy Land there can be no doubt. It is impossible to
read the letters or records handed down from those times
without remarking that amidst the whirl of events where
ambition, hatred, avarice, and national jealousy reigned on
all sides, obscuring and crippling all efforts to do good, the
honest endeavours of Frederick to ameliorate the condition
of the country, were not altogether unsuccessful.</p>

<p>On the 1st of May, after a stay of not more than eight
months in the Holy Land, the emperor took ship at Akkon,
accompanied by the young King of Cyprus and the Marquis
of Montserrat. As the boat which put him on board left the
land, Ibelin shouted after him a parting adieu, on which
the emperor called out to the assembled multitude, that his
mind was quite at ease, inasmuch as he knew that he left
them in good hands.</p>

<p>The imperial fleet crossed over to Limasol, and here
Frederick celebrated the marriage of his ward, the young
king, with Alice, daughter of the Marquis of Montserrat.
He then put in order the affairs of the island, arranging that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
the regency should regularly transmit to the governors of
Jerusalem or Akkon money wherewith to supply the garrisons
and officials in the Holy Land.</p>

<p>The emperor attached great importance to the possession
of the Cyprian castles and fortresses. Already in the preceding
year he had made every preparation for their defence,
by putting each of them under the command of some distinguished
officer, and had brought with him from Akkon
whatever could be spared in the way of munitions of war for
their safe keeping. As he was about to leave the island for
the second time, he stipulated that the regents should have no
power over the castles until the transmission of the money to
the Holy Land had been regularly completed.</p>

<p>The seaboard of Cyprus at that time had no fortresses, with
the exception of the capital city Nikosia; even on the south-western
coast, where a mountainous district occupies nearly
one-half of the island, there was no castle of importance, the
hills moreover must at that time have been covered with
wild-growing forests. The life and wealth of the island
consisted in the rich maritime slopes and fertile plains, which
extended along the shore from Famagusta and Larnaka, as
far as the mountainous tract, which extends all along the
northern side of the island.</p>

<p>Behind the chain of mountains are narrow slips of fertile
soil, producing abundance of excellent fruit, in the midst of
which is the principal haven Keryneia. From this town
deep dells and rocky gorges run up into the mountains, lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>ing
to the fortresses St. Hilarion, Buffavento, and Cantara.
These three castles are built upon the smaller chain of
mountains, which, rugged and steep, rear themselves in innumerable
peaks and crags to a considerable altitude.</p>

<p>Before the time of Frederick the Second, Buffavento is
scarcely mentioned, but it then became one of the principal
defences of the island, indeed it seems to have been quite
impregnable, so long as food and water could be procured on
the summit of the mountain upon which it stood. Victuals
were, however, much more easily obtainable on the heights of
St. Hilarion, a much larger place, situated a little further
westward. Even Kantara, lying to the north-east, could boast
of more than one wall.</p>

<p>The town of Keryneia, however, where the haven was
situated, was most strongly fortified, inasmuch as it was well
adapted to the reception of food and military stores arriving
from the coasts of Syria, Asia Minor, or even Italy, which
could be immediately forwarded to the fortresses above
mentioned.</p>

<p>Had the eagle eye of Frederick at once seen how Cyprus
could best be defended by a limited body of troops, he could
not have been better prepared for the events which subsequently
happened. A war soon broke out which, during
several years, continued to rage throughout the island, the
history of which gives a most variegated picture of the doings
of the knights beyond the sea, <i>chevalerie d’outre-mer</i>, as they
were called by the Eastern warriors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span></p>

<p>Homeric combats upon a fair field, trials by battle, the
beleaguering and defence of castles, codes laying down
the nicest points of honour, or of right, biting satires and
new war songs, followed each other, as incessantly as did
the victories or the defeats of the combatants. That all the
knights displayed wonderful bravery is undeniable. As the
head of the imperial forces, we may mention the knightly
Marshal Felingher, Balas, called by Navarra in his history,
“the Fox,” and Hugo de Giblet, who, on account of his
grimaces, was nicknamed “the Ape.” Ibelin seems to have
made himself more conspicuous than the rest. His brave
sons and their friend, the merry poet, Philip of Navarre, as
also the wild “fighting cock” Anselm de Brie, afforded
materials for innumerable anecdotes.</p>

<p>All this time Cyprus suffered severely, owing to the discord
which existed between two parties of nobles, whose enmity at
length involved Syria and Palestine, where the Templars and
Knights of St. John, together with what was left of the
priesthood, raged with unmeasured hatred against the emperor,
whose witty jests, aimed at the silly practices of the monks,
had given great offence, more especially when, after the example
of the Templars, they displayed their insatiable avarice.
The dissensions among the Cyprian nobles were, indeed, the
cause why all the arrangements made by the wisdom and care
of Frederick, in treating with the Mussulmans, fell to the
ground.</p>

<p>Still, for a time, the treaty which had cost so much trouble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
continued in force, notwithstanding that one of the two
governors in the Holy Land, in whom the Emperor had
reposed so much trust, Walter d’Allemand, joined the party
of his mortal enemies, and himself became a Templar.
Frederick, meanwhile, had scarcely set foot in Italy, than
he fell like a thunderstorm upon the Papal soldiers, and
fairly swept them from his territories. He then began to
diminish somewhat the possessions of the Templars, who had
multiplied in Italy with a rapidity almost incredible. In truth,
wherever a chapter of the order was established, the country
around was immediately put under contribution, and so
many farms, mills, castles, and woods were taken possession
of, either by way of purchase or exchange, or seized upon as
donations, that their power increased wonderfully. From the
Templars, more especially, a cry soon rose that Frederick
intended to make the kingdoms of Jerusalem and Cyprus
portions of his empire, so that they would both belong
exclusively to the Germans, a cry which was incessantly
repeated by the Jerusalem patriarch. It was also said that,
seeing that the kingdom of Jerusalem would be inherited by
Frederick’s little son, Conrad, his proper guardian would be
the nearest relative of the last wearer of that crown, they,
therefore, wished to put him under the care of the Queen
Alice, and in this way prolong the duration of the regency.</p>

<p>It now became evident that the rule of the emperor in the
Holy Land would not be of long duration, and his enemies
next resolved to endeavour to wrest from him the kingdom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
of Cyprus. Still, the regency of five retained supreme command
in that island, and acted altogether in accordance with
the emperor’s instructions. The young king wrote to his
imperial guardian to say how delighted he was at the
advantages obtained over his enemies, but that he was
grieved to find that the emperor did not write to him more
frequently concerning his views and projects, and still more
so, that he could not explain matters to him <i>in propriâ persona</i>.</p>

<p>The Ibelins, in the meanwhile, were in want of some
pretext for raising an insurrection in Cyprus. About
the spring of 1230, there was a call for an extraordinary
tax of about three thousand marks, which the emperor had
directed to be sent to the Holy Land. The knights, who
were of Ibelin’s party, declared against this, assigning as a
reason that, not having been assented to by the feudal court,
the imposition of a new tax was unlawful. As their stewards
refused payment, their goods were seized, and the amount
taken from them in corn and cattle.</p>

<p>And now Philip of Navarre appeared upon the island, and
secretly endeavoured to raise adherents. At first his answers
to the inquiries of the authorities seemed satisfactory, but as
they became more and more evasive, the regency thought fit
to compel him to show his true colours. All the barons were
invited to attend the feudal court, and there, in the presence
of the young king, were asked whether they were friends to
the emperor, the king, and the regents, or whether they were
to be regarded as enemies.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span></p>
<p>A New Testament was brought, and Philip of Navarre
was invited to swear true allegiance upon the holy book.
He wished to speak privately to each of his questioners, but
this was refused. He then declared that his fealty was due
to the queen-mother, and to the lord Ibelin. At this Hugo
von Giblet exclaimed in a rage, “If I had my way you
should be hanged, or I would have your tongue torn out,”
and immediately ordered the arrest of the offender. On this
Philip hastened to where the king was sitting, and, bending
the knee, said, that his safety had been guaranteed by the
regents, as he would prove with his sword, and immediately
taking off his glove, cast it on the ground.</p>

<p>Several knights endeavoured to pick up the glove; but
Philip cried out that he would only measure swords with the
regents, as they only were his equals in rank: fetters were
however, soon brought into the hall, where the contumacious
noble was imprisoned until the approach of darkness.
The rest all took the required oath, and it was
understood that all who refused to do so would forfeit
their rich domains.</p>

<p>In the night, while Philip’s conduct was the theme of
every one’s conversation, he made his escape from the court-house,
and presented himself in the cloisters of the Knights
of St. John, who immediately afforded him shelter and
protection. Here he assembled around his person about a
hundred and fifty men, collected provisions and warlike
stores, which were stored up in the strong tower of the castle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
and resolved to defend himself against his pursuers. Meanwhile
he sent a private message to Ibelin, informing him of
all his proceedings, which he described in verse.</p>

<p>The regents dared not to attack the monastery of St.
John, which enjoyed all the privileges of a religious house,
while Ibelin at once landed with a strong force in Gatria, and
marched in all haste to Nikosia. The few troops, which were
hurriedly sent to oppose him, were easily dispersed, and in a
very short time he presented himself before the capital. For
the sake of saving his honour, he had written a letter to the
young king, saying how it pained both him and his followers,
to have left their allegiance in the Holy Land, but that they
were unable to do otherwise, in order to defend their own
possessions; should he blame them for their conduct, they
relied upon their rights as established by feudal law. The
regents were utterly surprised; they at once collected such
forces as they could muster, and marched out through the
city gates. In vain did they seek for priestly interference for
the purpose of establishing peace between the conflicting
parties. On the 23rd of June a furious battle took place.
The regents wore golden tiaras on their helmets. One of
them, Gavain von Chenichy, slew Ibelin’s father-in-law, the
old constable; Walter von Cæsarea, Gerhardt von Montagu,
and other friends of Ibelin, likewise lost their lives. The
regents, however, were particularly anxious to get hold of
Ibelin himself, and fifteen knights galloped forward in search
of him. This, it would appear, caused considerable disorder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
amongst the imperial troops; and when Philip of Navarre,
with a strong body of men, made his appearance upon the
battle-field just at this critical moment, the troops of
the regents were completely defeated. Ibelin in the
meanwhile had sought refuge in a farm-house, where he
was powerless to defend himself, but from which, after the
battle, he was set at liberty by his son Balian and Anselm de
Brie.</p>

<p>And now appeared the foresight of the emperor in fortifying
the castles upon the mountains, in which the vanquished
troops found a safe asylum. On the very evening of the
battle, Balas, Bethsan, and Giblet, bringing with them
the young king and their best troops, repaired to St. Hilarion.
Rivet, with his followers, sought protection in Buffavento,
and Chenichy, by dint of spurring, succeeded in reaching the
still more distant castle of Kantara. From these three castles
it was easy to reach the sea-coast at Keryneia. Ibelin, however,
hastened to prevent their escape. While he himself surrounded
Keryneia, Balian took a position before St. Hilarion,
Philip of Navarre before Buffavento, and Anselm de Brie
before Kantara.</p>

<p>Anselm had devised a new kind of battering ram with
which he broke down the outer wall, and as he personally
hated Chenichy, laid in ambush watching for him day and
night, until at length, taking an opportunity when the regent
was seen on the battlements, took deadly aim at him and shot
him with an arrow. Rivet, who knew Buffavento to be im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>pregnable,
came there from Kantara, and when he saw the
fortalice was in good condition and well manned, went over
into Asia Minor to bring over more troops, and was there
killed.</p>

<p>The three other regents occupied the extensive and strong
fastnesses of St. Hilarion; here they not only repelled every
attack, but every now and then made sallies, broke through
the palisades of the besiegers, and obtained fresh supplies.</p>

<p>Upon one occasion Philip of Navarre was struck down and
fell as though dead. On seeing this a man upon the wall
exclaimed, “the verse-maker is dead, now we shall have no
more of his bad songs.” Philip, however, recovered during
the night, and the next day, taking up a tolerably safe position,
he favoured the garrison with a new ballad.</p>

<p>The defenders of Keryneia became at length tired out; for
a length of time they had received no pay and had suffered
much from want of provisions. A day was fixed, and if by
that time no help appeared, they agreed to surrender, more
especially as they saw that the castles were closely invested
and their occupants had no chance of escape.</p>

<p>Ibelin was now enabled to bring up more troops to the
siege of St. Hilarion. That fortress, however, was now no
longer in a condition to brave him as it had done before; the
place was closely invested on all sides, and the garrison in
dire want of provisions, for by this time the insurgents had
taken possession of the whole island; even the young king
Heinrich suffered severely; he frequently made his appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
upon the battlements and shouted to the besiegers who had
brought him to such straits.</p>

<p>Ibelin next resolved to send Philip of Navarre, who had
shown great ability in conducting negotiations, into Italy,
hoping to obtain help, either from the Pope or from the King
of France.</p>

<p>At this juncture Ibelin proposed to Balian and his associates
to surrender the young king and the fortress into his
power, promising that if they did so, they should be well
treated and should retain in all honour whatever property
they possessed. The garrison, which had long suffered the
greatest privations, and saw nothing before them but a
lingering death from famine, at last consented, and Ibelin
attained his object. Balas, Bethsan, and Giblet made over
to him the youthful Heinrich, and took a solemn oath that
they would not again bear arms against the insurgents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span></p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER XXXI<br /><br />
<small><small>MARSHAL FELINGHER.</small></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> emperor could no longer hide from himself that
Cyprus was lost, and his affairs in the Holy Land wore a
very gloomy aspect. By his command the governor of
Cyprus issued a proclamation depriving the Ibelins of all
their feudal tenures, and a fleet was assembled consisting of
eighteen galleys and fifteen transports, in the last of which
were embarked three hundred horsemen and two thousand
foot soldiers. These were all placed under the command of
Marshal Felingher by a manifesto, to which was appended a
golden ball, appointing him Governor, Lord Chief Justice,
and Generalissimo of the East, and at the same time affording
him every facility for getting his troops together.
Ibelin had taken the precaution to send spies into Italy, from
whom he received secret information concerning everything
that occurred there, and before the imperial fleet had left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
Brindisi, a swift sailing vessel was despatched, by which the
spies returned speedily to the east, and soon reaching Akkon,
where Ibelin was at that time encamped, made him acquainted
with all the proceedings of the emperor.</p>

<p>Without loss of time Ibelin assembled as many men as he
and his friends could get together, and marched upon Beyrut,
the defences of which he strengthened, and then crossed over
to Cyprus, where it was necessary to take care that on seeing
the emperor’s fleet the Cyprians should not rouse their forces,
and get the young king into their power. He therefore
collected all his adherents in Cyprus, knights and squires,
and a considerable number of combatants, placing part of
them at Limasol, under the command of his eldest son Balian,
and retaining the other part under his own control at
Larnaka, thus getting possession of the only two places where
a landing could be effected. He likewise took the precaution
of bringing with him the young king, upon whose movements
he kept a close watch.</p>

<p>When, therefore, the soldiers of the emperor were about
to land at Limasol, they found the shore lined with troops
forming an army much larger than their own, who forbad
their approach. Their ships, therefore, moved on a little
further, and cast anchor in the vicinity of Gavata. Soon
afterwards, the Bishop of Amalfi, accompanied by two
German knights, made their appearance in Limasol, and
represented themselves as ambassadors from the emperor
charged with a message to the young king. They were told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
that the king resided at Larnaka, and whilst they were conducted
back again to their ship, Ibelin in great haste called
together the feudal court, in which naturally his own friends
and partisans were in a considerable majority.</p>

<p>Before this assembly, the ambassadors from the emperor
delivered their message, which was to the following effect.
The emperor demanded from the king, as his feudal vassal,
that he should immediately banish from the country Johann
von Ibelin and his whole family, and no longer afford them
shelter or protection, seeing that they had broken their
allegiance. To this mandate the following reply was given
by Wilhelm Visconta, in the name of the infant king:
“My lords, I am commanded and commissioned by the
king to say to you, that it appears to him very strange that the
emperor should send such an order to me. The governor of
Beyrut is a relative of Ibelin, and I neither can nor will do
what the emperor requires.”</p>

<p>After waiting many days it became evident that it would
be impossible to effect a landing, and the authority of the
Emperor Frederick over the island was henceforth set at
defiance.</p>

<p>When Ibelin had marched within four leagues of Akkon,
he learnt that the Patriarch of Antioch was sent as Pope’s
legate to that city, and had demanded his immediate presence.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the suspicions Ibelin entertained, that
the legate was about to denounce him as a rebel, he felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
bound, as a good servant of the Church, to obey the summons.
He therefore caused his troops to encamp near Casal Imbert,
and placed his trustworthy follower, Anselm von Brie, in
command, whilst he proceeded to Akkon, and endeavoured
by every means in his power to undermine his enemies and
strengthen his own cause.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Marshal Felingher decided on making one
decisive blow for his master’s interests. Towards dusk on
the evening of May the 2nd, he left Tyre with his best troops,
and marched towards the coast, where he was followed by
twenty-two ships bearing the rest of his army. Towards
morning they approached the unfortunate camp, and before
the slightest alarm could be raised, had fallen upon it and
butchered the soldiers, whilst still asleep. Here and there
a slight attempt was made at resistance, and Ibelin’s three
sons made a gallant but desperate effort to drive off the
enemy. The attack, however, had been too sudden to allow
the soldiers to recover from the shock, and all such as did
not perish found safety in precipitate flight. The king
narrowly escaped with his life, he having been hurried out
of the camp at the first alarm of danger.</p>

<p>The imperial victory was complete, Ibelin’s troops were
entirely scattered or destroyed, and all the valuables of the
camp were taken possession of by the enemy. As soon as it
was known that Marshal Felingher had left Tyre, Ibelin and
his knights at once mounted their horses and rode as rapidly
as possible towards the camp, but before they arrived, friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
and enemies had alike quitted the ground, and nothing remained
except a handful of men who had taken refuge in a
small and neighbouring tower.</p>

<p>Had Felingher at once fallen upon Akkon, he would probably
have obtained possession of the city; but he was well
aware that his troops were safer in Cyprus than on the opposite
continent, and therefore immediately despatched them to
that island. Famagusta, Nikosia, and Keryneia were seized,
and all Ibelin’s troops dispersed in a series of victorious onslaughts.
The young queen, Alice, occupied Nikosia, whilst
her two sisters-in-law took refuge in the convent of St.
Hilarion. Frau von Ibelin escaped to Buffavento in the disguise
of a monk, and by her courage and energy roused the
drooping spirit of the old commandant of the fortress, who
was preparing to surrender to the emperor at discretion.</p>

<p>The followers of Ibelin were now in the depths of distress
and anxiety, their troops were annihilated, their money gone,
and worst of all, many noble knights belonging to the conquered
party began to lay all the blame of their unfortunate
position upon their leader’s head. Some endeavoured to persuade
the king, who was nearly of age, that he might be the
means of restoring peace and order, whilst others endeavoured
to commence an alliance with Marshal Felingher.</p>

<p>At this crisis, John Ibelin showed all the resources of which
he was capable. He tried to sting the Syrian knights by
hinting, that if Cyprus were allowed to remain under imperial
rule, they would be neither more nor less than slaves to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
Germany, and endeavoured by bribes and every form of persuasion
to induce adherents to flock to his standard. Ibelin’s
sons and relations sold all their possessions in order to obtain
horses and arms, and many devices were resorted to as a
means of obtaining money.</p>

<p>Small scraps of parchment were issued, bearing the king’s
seal, and setting forth that the sum named thereon must be
paid to whoever presented it, and promising that the giver
should be refunded as soon as the prince was firmly established
in his rights.</p>

<p>The most important step by far taken by the astute
knight at this crisis, was that of persuading the Genoese in
the island to rise <i>en masse</i> and join his cause, under the
solemn promise of the king that they and their sons should
enjoy extraordinary social immunities and privileges. Having
fully achieved this plan, Ibelin at once made ready to sail
for Cyprus at the shortest notice, backed by a numerous and
well-manned fleet. No sooner did the marshal hear of the
unexpected rising of the Genoese, than he at once returned
to the island with a powerful army, and was soon again
master of the whole country, with the exception of the
fortresses of St. Hilarion and Buffavento. A portion of the
imperial fleet was anchored in the harbour outside the ancient
city of Paphos.</p>

<p>On Whitsunday, May the 30th, Ibelin set sail with his
forces from Akkon, accompanied by the Genoese consul, with
whom the approaching struggle now had the aspect of a poli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>tical
victory. Pedalion Acra, a promontory between Larnaka
and Famagusta, had been pointed out as the most suitable spot
for landing the soldiers, and thither all the troop-ships went.
No sooner had the fleet reached the spot indicated, than intelligence
was received that the marshal had made Famagusta his
head-quarters. The ships at once proceeded in the direction
of that fortress, where, owing to the knowledge of the shore
displayed by their commanders, they were enabled, after a slight
skirmish with the imperial troops, to take possession of a small
island in close vicinity to the town. Felingher was prepared
to make a brave and powerful defence, but unluckily for him
his soldiers had treated the surrounding inhabitants with so
much roughness and cruelty that treachery was rife in all
quarters. In the stillness of the night a few boats left the
fleet, and landed their men close to the fortress; these at once
rushed upon the town with such noise and force that the defenders
were struck with sudden panic. The marshal,
believing that the whole force of the enemy was on the spot,
and that the citizens were in revolt, at once set fire to his
ships, and withdrew with all his men to Nikosia.</p>

<p>Ibelin remained a week in Famagusta; this time he spent
in fortifying the citadel more securely, and in drawing up the
deed of privileges to the Genoese, the promise of which had
procured him so great an accession of friends.</p>

<p>The marshal now retired to the mountains behind Nikosia,
and Queen Alice and her ladies sought refuge in Keryneia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
the imperial troops being so stationed as to command that
fortress.</p>

<p>Felingher now rapidly pressed on the siege of St. Hilarion,
and was in daily hopes that hunger must compel her defenders
to surrender; all cornfields, mills, and every available means
of sustenance having been destroyed throughout the surrounding
plains by the marshal’s orders.</p>

<p>Ibelin’s army, which was now slowly marching onwards
towards Nikosia, received fresh reinforcements at every stage,
not only from the outraged Cypriotes, who were anxious to
avenge their wrongs, but from large numbers of the higher
classes, who had taken refuge in the huts. Nearly all these
soldiers were on foot, whilst the imperial army, we are told,
had fully two thousand horse. On his arrival near Nikosia,
Ibelin at once encamped about half a league from the city,
and early next morning, June 15th, 1232, advanced rapidly
with all his troops to encounter the imperial forces, some of
which were gathered around the fortress they were investing,
whilst some were stationed upon the high and almost inaccessible
rocks that commanded the road to Keryneia.</p>

<p>The marshal, who appears to have been paralysed by the
rapid movements of the enemy, at once sent a party of cavalry
to meet the men he saw were preparing to mount the rocky
steps that led to the fortress.</p>

<p>Count Walter von Manebel charged down upon the enemy,
but with such fury and indiscretion that the ascending soldiers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
being on foot, readily eluded the pursuit of their mounted
adversaries, who had no alternative but to seek refuge in the
plains below, and there await further orders. Meanwhile
Ibelin’s troops continued to mount, and a severe struggle ensued,
in which the marshal’s troops became perfectly unmanageable,
and had to be withdrawn to Keryneia. Numbers sought
safety in flight, or refuge in the neighbouring churches and
monasteries. Keryneia now alone remained in the hands of
the imperial troops, and the marshal at once proceeded to
strengthen it at all points, stored up ample provisions in case
of siege, and having given the command of such troops as
could not be accommodated in the fortress to Walter von
Aquaviva, he himself retired to Cilicia with a large body of
men.</p>

<p>Ibelin no sooner heard that the marshal had withdrawn the
greater part of his army from Keryneia, than he proceeded to
invest that fortress. A long and bloody battle at once ensued
outside its walls, and every means were tried, but in vain, to
storm the citadel. At this crisis a short truce was concluded, in
consequence of the death of the young Queen Alice. Her
corpse was decked in royal robes, and a messenger was
despatched to her consort requesting that she might be
interred as became her rank. This truce was strictly kept
on both sides, until the royal coffin had been conveyed to
Nikosia, where it was placed in the cathedral with much
pomp and reverence.</p>

<p>Marshal Felingher had meanwhile been well received in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
Cilicia, and at once proceeded to make preparations for a
fresh campaign. Great sickness, however, now appeared in
his army, and numbers died from various causes, or were so
invalided as to be unfit for farther service. Felingher at
once ordered his army to Tyre, whilst he himself went to
Italy to have an interview with the emperor. This latter was
now inclined to try what could be done by persuasion, instead
of again having recourse to arms. Marshal Felingher, who
had made himself much disliked, was superseded, and the
Bishop of Sidon despatched, with full powers to bring
matters to a peaceable conclusion by well-timed arguments
and persuasions, amongst which was the promise that all past
outbreaks should be forgotten on the part of the emperor, if
the Cypriotes would return to their allegiance. The bishop
had so much skill and diplomacy, that in an assembly of
knights called by his order, to assemble in the cathedral at
Akkon, all present willingly consented to renew their oath
on the spot, and recognise the emperor as the guardian of his
son Conrad. At this juncture the proceedings of the assembly
were interrupted by the sudden appearance of the young
knight, John of Cæsarea, nephew of Ibelin, who with much
excitement implored the assembly to consider well what they
were about to do, and not to sacrifice their country to imperial
ambition.</p>

<p>A scene of great violence ensued, in the midst of which
the bell from the citadel was rung, and at the preconcerted
signal, crowds of Ibelin’s adherents in the city flocked into and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
around the church, uttering loud cries for vengeance on the
heads of the recreant knights. The latter were now compelled
to seek safety in flight, and it required all the eloquence and
authority of young John of Cæsarea to restrain the violence of
the crowd, and allow the bishop and his party to escape with
their lives. The emperor now appealed to Ibelin’s own sense
of right and honour, and assured him that if he would obey
the imperial summons and appear in Tyre to renew his fealty,
everything should be arranged according to his wishes.
Ibelin, however, distrusted the friendly overtures of the
emperor, and not only refused to comply, but at once proceeded
to levy fresh forces, and prepare for an obstinate resistance.
This done, his first step was to reduce the fortress
of Keryneia, which, however, he found so impregnable, that
after some terrible fighting about its walls, he was compelled
to sit down before it, and endeavour to reduce its garrison by
starvation. Month after month passed, and yet the brave
band held out; until after two years of great hardship and
suffering, they were at last compelled to submit, but only on
the most honourable conditions. Frederick still refused to
relinquish all hope, and now had recourse to imploring assistance
from the Pope, to aid in bringing his refractory vassals
again to their allegiance. In the same year as witnessed the
fall of Keryneia, a legate from the Papal Court arrived at
Akkon, bearing a decree from both emperor and Pope, commanding
all knights and citizens to join the imperial cause,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
and submit to the authority of Marshal Felingher. Every
indulgence was promised to all such as should submit.</p>

<p>Ibelin was now hard pressed, but he utterly refused again
to acknowledge his faults to the emperor, and at once set
about preparing for an attack on Tyre. The Pope sent
Ibelin one more written warning, and the archbishop put
Akkon under an interdict. Two envoys were now sent from
the knights to Italy, in order to endeavour to make terms of
peace. These conditions were hard upon the Cypriotes, and
when the envoys returned to Akkon, and showed the parchment
containing the required submissions, the whole city was
in an uproar. The ambassadors were thrown into prison,
and very narrowly escaped with their lives. Almost Ibelin’s
last act was to summon all to uphold the rights of their
king; very shortly after this he fell from his horse, and was
so seriously injured that he did not long survive. During
these occurrences in the East, great changes were also
taking place in the friendly relations between the Pope and
emperor, and the latter soon found himself overwhelmed
with troubles and anxieties, both in Italy and Germany, which
required his immediate and entire attention. Meanwhile
Ibelin’s son and various members of his family had sent
letters accompanied by rich gifts to the Pope and cardinals.
This embassy proved entirely successful, and the envoy, Godfrey
le Tort, returned triumphantly to Akkon, bearing a Papal
letter commanding all to unite with the Genoese in submis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>sion
to the wishes and propositions of the party led by the
Ibelins. This direct decree from the Pope proved final, and
Frederick was now powerless to send an army to assert his
claims.</p>

<p>Some years later, one more endeavour was made by
Marshal Felingher, and a small party in Akkon, to induce the
inhabitants of the island to acknowledge their allegiance to
the emperor; but in vain. Thus ended all attempts to make
Cyprus an appanage of Germany, which if carried out might
probably have saved that beautiful country and her population
from centuries of neglect and tyranny.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER XXXII<br /><br />
<small><small>CYPRUS AND THE EUPHRATES VALLEY RAILWAY.</small></small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Again</span> must Cyprus bear a prominent position in the eyes
of the world. For many years eminent statesmen, soldiers,
and engineers have been proclaiming the advisability of
making Cyprus the point through which that grand scheme,
the Euphrates Valley Railway, soon we hope to be a reality,
would receive its principal sources of traffic, and forming it
into the terminal station of a line of railway and steamers
destined to chain us more firmly to our Indian possessions,
and to open again the long-deserted or neglected land that
lies between it and the Persian Gulf.</p>

<p>Major-General Sir F. Goldsmid, C.B., K.C.S.I., who has
devoted a considerable portion of his time to this scheme, has
thrown such valuable light upon the subject that we should
be wanting in our duty to our readers if we did not give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
some brief idea of the information his valuable paper
affords us.</p>

<p>The geographical position of Cyprus, now under British
rule, makes the island a fitting guardian of Upper Syria,
Cœlo Syria, and almost of Palestine, and in the hands of
Great Britain is an invaluable acquisition, and worth any
amount of land which might be purchased on the neighbouring
Asiatic coast.</p>

<p>The distance to the several ports on the mainland is not
great; indeed, the island is said to be visible on a clear day
from Seleucia. A railway terminus for the Persian Gulf
line might be reached in a very few hours, and fair weather
boats, calculated to carry over a thousand passengers, troops
or civilians, might be used at certain times at inconsiderable
cost.</p>

<p>Of Larnaka, as a port, very little information can be obtained;
but fifteen years ago it received 324 vessels of 54,340
tons, and sent out 321 vessels of 53,458 tons. In 1876 there
were entered 457, and cleared 483 vessels of 92,926 and
91,690 tons respectively.</p>

<p>At Limasol, in 1863, 493 vessels were entered of 32,980
tons. The present harbour of Famagusta has a superficial
extent of nearly eighty acres, to which a depth of five and a
half fathoms might be readily given; but there is only a
space of about five acres which can be relied upon for the
actual reception of ships.</p>

<p>M. Collas, a French writer, experienced in Turkey and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
Turks, thinks that, with ordinary engineering skill, a harbour
might be formed here of more than 148 acres in extent.
The opening of this harbour would also give, in the opinion
of M. Collas, an immense impetus to the export of cotton,
which might be grown up to the amount not far short of
30,000 tons, a high figure of productiveness.</p>

<p>Having thus shown how Cyprus is capable, so far as
harbours are concerned, of fulfilling her position as the
terminus of the Euphrates Valley Railway, let us look to
some of the various routes suggested for this line. Five
different schemes were selected as the most important by
the Committee which sat in 1872.</p>

<p>1st. A line starting from Alexandretta or Suedia, near the
mouth of the Orontes, passing through Aleppo to the Euphrates,
at or near Jabah Castle, and thence carried down
the right bank of the river to Kuwait, on the western side of
the Persian Gulf.</p>

<p>2nd. A line starting from one of the same points, crossing
the Euphrates at Belio, passing down the left bank of the
river, or the right bank of the Tigris, to a point nearly opposite
Baghdad, recrossing the Euphrates, and proceeding to
Kuwait.</p>

<p>3rd. A line starting as before, crossing the Euphrates at
Bir, thence going round to Orfah and Diarbekir, and following
the right bank of the Tigris as the last.</p>

<p>4th. A similar line, only following the left bank of the
Tigris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span></p>

<p>5th. A line starting from Tripoli, and proceeding across
the desert by way of Damascus and Palmyra to the Euphrates,
whence it might follow one of the preceding routes.</p>

<p>Which of these routes will eventually be adopted, is still
the subject of much discussion.</p>

<p>Mr. W. P. Andrew, F.R.G.S., who for thirty years has
devoted much time and attention to endeavouring to carry out
this design, has furnished us with an admirable report on this
project. We will give a short sketch in his own words:</p>

<p>“In the proposal to restore this ancient route—once the
highway of the world’s commerce and the track of the heroes
of early history—by the construction of a railway to connect
the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf, we have at hand
an invaluable and perfectly efficient means at once of thwarting
the designs of Russia, if they should assume a hostile
character, of marching hand in hand with her if her mission
be to carry civilisation to distant lands, and of competing with
her in the peaceful rivalry of commerce.”</p>

<p>“On every ground, therefore, the proposed Euphrates
Valley Railway is an undertaking eminently deserving our
attention, and the support and encouragement of our Government.”</p>

<p>“The countries which our future highway to India will
traverse have been, from remote antiquity, the most interesting
in the world. On the once fertile plains, watered by the
Euphrates and Tigris, the greatest and most glorious nations
of antiquity arose, flourished, and were overthrown.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span></p>

<p>“Twice in the world’s history, mankind commenced the
race of civilisation on the Mesopotamian rivers. Twice
the human family diverged from their banks to the east, the
west, and the north. Arts and sciences made the first feeble
steps of their infancy, upon the shores of these rivers.”</p>

<p>“Very early in history we know that Babylon was a great
manufacturing city, famed for the costly fabric of its looms.
At a more recent date the Chaldean kings made it a gorgeous
metropolis—the fairest and the richest then on earth. Alexander
of Macedon made it the port of the Indian Ocean and
the Persian Gulf; and he proposed to render it the central
metropolis of his empire.”</p>

<p>“The countries through which the Euphrates flows were
formerly the most productive in the world. Throughout
these regions the fruits of temperate and tropical climes, grew
in bygone days in luxurious profusion; luxury and abundance
were universally diffused. The soil everywhere teemed
with vegetation; much of this has since passed away. Ages
of despotism and misrule have rendered unavailing the bounty
of nature; but the land is full of hidden riches. The natural
elements of its ancient grandeur still exist in the inexhaustible
fertility of the country, and in the chivalrous character and
bearing of many of the tribes; and the day cannot be far
distant when it is destined to resume its place amongst the
fairest and most prosperous regions of the globe.”</p>

<p>“The wondrous fertility of Mesopotamia was, in early
times, carried to its utmost limit by means of irrigation canals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
with which the country was everywhere intersected, and some
of the largest of which were navigable. These excited the
wonder and interest of Alexander the Great, who, after his
return from the conquest of India, examined them personally,
steering the boat with his own hand. He employed a great
number of men to repair and cleanse these canals.”</p>

<p>“Herodotus, speaking of Babylonia, says: ‘Of all the
countries I know, it is without question the best and
the most fertile. It produces neither figs, nor vines, nor
olives; but in recompense the earth is suitable for all sorts of
grain, of which it yields always two hundred per cent, and in
years of extraordinary fertility as much as three hundred per
cent.’”</p>

<p>“These regions need only again to be irrigated by the life-giving
waters pouring down ever cool and plentiful from
Ararat—that great landmark of primæval history, now the
vast natural boundary-stone of the Russian, Turkish, and
Persian empires—to yield once more in abundance almost
everything that is necessary or agreeable to man. Many
acres now wasted, save when in early spring they are
wildernesses of flowers, may be covered with cotton, tending
to the employment of the million spindles of our land.”</p>

<p>“It is not too much to say that no existing or projected railroad
can compare in point of interest and importance with
that of the Euphrates Valley. It will bring two quarters of
the globe into juxtaposition, and three continents, Europe,
Asia, and Australia, into closer relation. It will bind the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
vast population of Hindustan by an iron link with the people
of Europe. It will inevitably entail the colonisation and
civilisation of the great valleys of the Euphrates and Tigris,
the resuscitation in a modern shape of Babylon and Nineveh,
and the re-awakening of Ctesiphon and Bagdad of old.”</p>

<p>“Where is there in the world any similar undertaking which
can achieve results of such magnitude, fraught with so many
interests to various nations? And who can foresee what
ultimate effects may be produced by improved means of
communication in the condition of Hindoos, Chinese, and
other remote peoples?”</p>

<p>“Although various routes have been suggested with a view
of bringing Great Britain, by means of railway communication,
into closer connection with India and her other dependencies
in the East, and of securing at the same time the
immense political and strategic desideratum of an alternative
highway to our Eastern possessions, there is none which
combines in itself so many advantages as the ancient route of
the Euphrates; the route of the emperors Trajan and Julian,
in whose steps, in more recent times, the great Napoleon
intended to follow, when the Russian campaign turned his
energies in another direction. The special advantages which
render this route superior to all others are briefly these:”</p>

<p>“It is the direct route to India. It is the shortest and the
cheapest both for constructing and working a railway; so free
from engineering difficulties, that it almost appears as though
designed by the hand of nature to be the highway of nations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
between the east and the west; the most surely defensible by
England—both of its termini being on the open seas; and
the most likely to prove remunerative.”</p>

<p>“Both in an engineering and a political point of view, the
Euphrates route undoubtedly possesses great advantages over
any of the others which have been proposed.”</p>

<p>“All the routes which have been suggested from places on
the Black Sea are open to the fatal objection that, while they
would be of the greatest service to Russia, they would be
altogether beyond the control of Great Britain, while the
engineering difficulties with which they are surrounded, are
of themselves sufficient to exclude them from practical consideration.”</p>

<p>“This has been fully established by the evidence of the
witnesses examined by the Select Committee of the House of
Commons, which lately investigated the merits of the various
proposals for connecting the Mediterranean and the Black
Seas with the Persian Gulf.”</p>

<p>“In the course of the investigation by the Committee, it was
demonstrated that the proposed Euphrates Valley Railway is
an eminently feasible undertaking in an engineering sense;
that the route of the Euphrates and the Persian Gulf is
decidedly preferable in respect of climate to that by Egypt and
the Red Sea; that as regards the safety and facility of the
navigation, the Persian Gulf also has by far the advantage;
that the proposed undertaking would be of great commercial
moment, and if not immediately profitable, at all events that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
it would be so at a date not far distant; and, finally, that it
would be of the highest political and strategic importance to
this country.”</p>

<p>“A railway through Mesopotamia, as a route to India,
would not at first be productive of much income to a company
from traffic, but in a few years—certainly before the railway
could be finished—the cultivation of grain would increase
a hundred-fold, and would go on increasing a thousand
fold, and would attain to a magnitude and extension quite
impossible to calculate, because bad harvests are almost unknown
in these parts, for there is always plenty of rain and
a hot sun to ripen the corn. Populous villages would spring
up all along the line, as there is abundance of sweet water
everywhere. Cereals can be grown there so cheaply, that no
country the same distance from England—say for instance
Russia—could compete with it at all. And if Great Britain
finds it necessary to rely more on the importation of foreign
corn, where could a better field be found than the fertile plains
of Mesopotamia, which has all the advantages of climate, soil,
and sun in its favour?”</p>

<p>“The establishment of steam communication by the Messageries
Maritimes on the route of the Red Sea to Calcutta
and other Eastern ports, shows the importance attached by
the French to the extension of their commercial relations
with the East. A Russian line of steamers, also, has lately
been established, to run between Odessa and Bombay by the
Suez Canal route. Even those who see no danger in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
policy of annexation pursued by Russia, will admit that
the Russian roads and railways now being pushed towards
Persia and Afghanistan, if designed with pacific intentions,
prove, at all events, the anxiety of the Russian Government
to compete with us for the trade of Central Asia, the Punjaub,
and Northern India.”</p>

<p>“The substitution of Kurrachee for Bombay as the European
port of India would, even by the Red Sea route, give
us an advantage of some five hundred miles; but if the
Euphrates route were once established, the adoption of Kurrachee
as the European port of India would necessarily
follow, and India would thus be brought upwards of a
thousand miles nearer to us than at present; while during
the monsoon months, the gain would be still greater, as the
route between the Persian Gulf and Kurrachee is not exposed
to the severity of the monsoon, which, it is well known,
renders a divergence of some five hundred miles necessary
during a portion of the year on the voyage from Bombay to
Aden.”</p>

<p>“When the railway system of the Indus is completed, Kurrachee
will be in continuous railway communication with
Calcutta and with the gates of Central Asia at the Kyber
and Bolan Passes, and it will thus become the natural basis
of operations in the event either of any internal commotion
in India, or of aggression on our north-western frontier.”</p>

<p>“The grand object desired, is to connect England with
the north-west frontier of India by steam transit through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
the Euphrates and Indus valleys. The latter will render
movable to either the Kyber or the Bolan—the two gates of
India—the flower of the British army cantoned in the Punjaub;
and the Euphrates and Indus lines being connected by
means of steamers, we should be enabled to threaten the
flank and rear of any force advancing through Persia
towards India. So that, by this great scheme, the invasion of
India would be placed beyond even speculation, and it is
evident that the great army of India of three hundred thousand
men being thus united to the army of England, the mutual
support they would render each other, would quadruple
the power and ascendancy of this country, and promote
powerfully the progress, the freedom, and the peace of
the world.”</p>

<p>“The Euphrates and Indus lines together would, moreover,
secure for us almost a monopoly of the trade with Central
Asia, enabling us to meet Russia, our great competitor in
these distant fields of commercial enterprise, on more than
equal terms.”</p>

<p>“But it is not on commercial considerations that I would
urge the claims of the Euphrates Valley Railway. It is on
imperial grounds that the scheme commends itself to our
support.”</p>

<p>“I believe that the establishment of the Euphrates route
would add incalculably to our prestige throughout Europe and
the East, and would do more to strengthen our hold on India
than any other means that could be devised.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span></p>

<p>“The Euphrates Valley Railway, as proposed from the Gulf
of Scanderoon to the Persian Gulf, has been specially designed
with a view to its ultimately forming part of a through line
from Constantinople to the head of the Persian Gulf; while
it is capable also of being in due time extended eastwards to
Kurrachee, the port of India nearest to Europe.”</p>

<p>“The line from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf has
been demonstrated to be eminently practicable and easy, while
the other portions of the route between Constantinople and
India are not. While capable of forming part of a through
line, it would at the same time be complete in itself, and independent
of any disturbances in Europe—the only portion,
in fact, of a through line of railway which would be always,
and under all circumstances, at the absolute control of this
country.”</p>

<p>“It would always be to this country the most important
portion of any through line; and, indeed, I believe a through
line could not be constructed, except at overwhelming cost,
without the assistance of a port in Northern Syria. It would,
moreover, provide us with a complete alternative route to
India, and would thus at once secure to this country advantages
admitted to be of the highest national moment.”</p>

<p>“It is for these reasons that during the long period in which
I have devoted myself to the advocacy of the Euphrates route
to India, I have thought it expedient to urge upon our own
Government and that of Turkey, the special claims of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
section only which would connect the Mediterranean with the
Persian Gulf.”</p>

<p>“The objection that, although the Euphrates Valley Railway
would afford us the undoubted advantage of an alternative,
a shorter, and a more rapid means of communication
with India, it would still leave a considerable portion of the
journey to be accomplished by sea, and that consequently it
would accelerate our communications with the East in a
minor degree only, is sufficiently disposed of by the circumstances
already pointed out; that a railway from a point on
the Mediterranean, at or near Scanderoon, to the head of the
Persian Gulf, would naturally form part of a through line of
railway from Constantinople to India, if at a future time it
should be considered necessary or desirable to construct the
remaining sections.”</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">APPENDIX.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Extent and Boundaries</span>.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cyprus</span> (χυπρος), called by the Turks Kibris, is a large
island in the Mediterranean, lying near the coasts of Syria and
Asia Minor. It is supposed to have an area of about 4500 square
miles, but all the different measurements given vary considerably.
Its length is about 145 miles, from the extreme north-east point,
Cape St. Andreas, to Cape Arnauti, on the west coast. Its
greatest breadth is about fifty miles from north to south;
but it narrows towards the east, where in some parts it is not
more than five miles wide, and, at the most extreme east point,
Cape Andreas, it is only about sixty-five miles distant from
Latakia, the nearest point of the Syrian coast. The nearest
land on the coast of Karamania, or Cilicia, Cape Zephyrium, is
about forty-two miles north by west of the point of land in
Cyprus, which is near the ancient Carpasia.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Surface.</span></h3>

<p>There are two ranges of mountains in Cyprus, one extending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
along the northern coast, and the other stretching across the
southern part of the island. The highest summit is the
“Troados,” or “Olympus,” which Löher measured, and found
to be 6160 feet above the sea level. The other principal peaks
of this range are Mount Stavrovuni, or Sante Croce, Mount
Makhaeras, and Mount Adelphi; the heights of these are uncertain.
Equally uncertain are the elevations of the peaks of
the northern range, the chief of which is Mount Pentedaktylo,
between Kerinia and Makaria.</p>

<p>The most extensive plain is on the eastern part of the island,
and is watered by the river Pedias. In 1330, this river was so
swollen by heavy rain, that it inundated Nikosia, to the great
destruction of life and property. The other plains of any size
are those of Lefkosia in the centre, and Kerinia, to the west of
the island.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Rivers.</span></h3>

<p>The Pedias, or Pedæus, the principal river, rises on the range
of Olympus, and waters the plains of Lefkosia and Messaria,
and empties itself into the sea, on the east coast, at the ancient
port of Salamis Constantia. The Morpha has its source among
the same mountains as the Pedias, waters the plain of Kerinia,
and falls into the sea on the north-west coast, about the centre
of the Gulf of Morpha. There are no other rivers of much
importance; the principal are, the Ezusa, or ancient Borgarus,
the Diorizos, and the Khapotini, all of which take their source
in the neighbourhood of Mount Olympus, and fall into the sea
on the south-west coast; the Kurios, which empties itself into
the Gulf of Piskopi, on the south coast; the Garilis, rising in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
the Makhaeras mountains and falling into the sea at Limasol,
also on the south coast; while the Pentaskhino, a small stream,
enters the sea near Dolos point, on the south-east coast.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Capes.</span></h3>

<p>Cape Kormaciti, the ancient Crommyon, at the extreme north-west;
Cape Andreas, the ancient Dinaretum, at the extreme
north-east point of the island; Cape Arnauti, or St. Epiphanio,
the ancient Akamas, at the most western point; Cape Gatto,
and Cape Zevgari, the ancient Kurios, are the furthest points on
the south coast; Cape Greco, the ancient Pedalion, lies at the
south-eastern extremity. On the north coast are Cape Plakoti;
on the west, Capes Drepani, Kokino, Limmity, Baffo (Papho); on
the east coast, Cape Elaea, and on the south, Capes Pyla, the
ancient Throni, Bianca, and Citi.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Gulfs and Bays.</span></h3>

<p>Famagusta Bay, or Bay of Salamis, at the east; Gulf of
Morpha, or Pendagia, at the north-west; Gulf of Chrysochou,
at the west; and at the south, the Gulf of Piskopi, and bays of
Larnaka and Akroteri.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Harbours and Roadsteads.</span></h3>

<p>Larnaka and Limasol possess good roadsteads.</p>

<p>The ancient harbours are destroyed and filled with sand.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Towns and Important Places.</span></h3>

<p>The following were the towns of Cyprus (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 25). On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
north coast of Cape Acamas, were Arsinoe, and Sali, with a
harbour founded by Phalerus and Acamas of Athens, then
east of Cape Crommyon, Lapethus, built by the Lacedemonians;
next Agidus, Aphrodisium, and Carpasia; east of
the last, was a mountain and a cape called Olympus, with a
temple to Venus upon it, which women were forbidden to enter.
Facing the cape are two small islands, called Keides, or “the
keys of Cyprus.” Turning thence towards the south, was Salamis,
at the mouth of the Pedæus, one of the principal cities
of the island, said to have been built by Teucer, an emigrant from
the island of Salamis.</p>

<p>Proceeding south was another Arsinoe, with a port; next
came Leucolia, near Cape Pedalium, a lofty table-land, called
the Table of Venus; west of Pedalium was Citium (the ancient
Chittim), with a harbour that could be closed. Citium was a
large town, and the birthplace of Zeno the Stoic (301 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>)
From Citium to Berytas (Bairout) in Syria, the distance was
about 130 miles. West of Citium was Amathus, and inland
was Palœa Limisso. Sailing round by Cape Curias to the west,
was the town of Curium, with a port built by the Argivi. Here
the coast turns to the north-west, looking towards Rhodes, and on
it were the towns of Ireta, Boosura, and Old Paphos; then Cape
Zephyrium; and next to it another Arsinoe, with a port and
temple, sacred grove, and New Paphos, built by Agapenor, five
miles by land from Old Paphos.</p>

<p>Most of the above towns, and others which Strabo has omitted,
have long since disappeared.</p>

<p>The present capital is Nikosia, the residence of the late
Turkish governor. It lies near the centre of the island, close
to the site of the ancient Letra, or Leucotra, on a plain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
surrounded with mountains. The streets are narrow and dirty,
and many of the grand old mansions falling into decay. It
is a truly Oriental city, and is very prettily situated; the air
is balmy, dry, and redolent of the odour of laurel and myrtle.
Every court-yard has its apple and pear-tree, and in between
these masses of rosemary, peeping from beneath the flourishing
fig. Its population does not exceed 16,000.</p>

<p>Lefkosia was the residence of the kings of the Lusignan
dynasty, and was then much larger than it is at present, the
Venetians having destroyed part of it in order to strengthen the
remainder.</p>

<p>The church of St. Sophia, a fine Gothic building, is converted
into a mosque; the monuments it contains of the Lusignans are
sadly mutilated. There is also a fine bazaar, a khan, or enclosed
court, surrounded by apartments for travellers, and the palace
of the governor, on the portal of which is still seen the Venetian
lion in stone; there are also several other churches and
mosques. The bastioned walls, erected by the Venetians, are
still standing.</p>

<p>The Greek Archbishop of Nikosia is metropolitan of the
whole island. Cesnola, informs us, that, after sundown, no
person is allowed to leave or enter the town without special
permission from the governor-general. When such a case
occurs, the soldiers are put under arms, and the drawbridge
is lowered, with as much ceremony as if we were still in
mediæval times. The seraglio, where the late Turkish governor
resided, is described by the same authority, as a large quadrangular
building, two stories high, and in sad want of repair;
it has a large court-yard, enclosed by walls twenty-five feet
high.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span></p>

<p>The principal manufactures of the town are carpets, cotton
prints, and morocco leather. The workmen of Nikosia pretend
that they have a particular manner of dressing the leather,
which they keep a profound secret; anyhow, the leather is said
to be better dressed, more brilliant in colour, and more durable
than that which is made in Turkey. There is also a little trade
in raw cotton and wine.</p>

<p>Larnaka, or Larnika, on the site of old Citium, near the
south coast, is the most thriving, bustling place, in the island,
being the residence of the European consuls and factors, and
the chief seat of trade. The port of Larnaka is at Salines,
about a mile and half distant; a Greek bishop resides there,
and there are also some Latin churches in the town. The
houses are chiefly built of clay and only one story high, on
account of the earthquakes, to which the island is subject. The
interiors of the houses are comfortable; the apartments are
paved with white marble, and almost every house has a garden.</p>

<p>This is the chief sea-port in the island, and has a fair
anchorage for vessels in the roadstead. Near Larnaka is the
well-known inland lake, whence in ancient days, the Phœnicians
obtained the best salt. During the rainy season, this is swollen
with water; in May and June it gradually evaporates, and
under the fiery sun, and burning heat of July and August, the
water almost boils off, and leaves behind a thick cake of nearly
pure salt. This once yielded a yearly income of three hundred
thousand ducats. This town is connected by telegraph with
Latakia, on the Syrian coast, the wires passing through Nikosia.</p>

<p>Famagusta, on the south-east coast, a few miles south of old
Salamis, and not far from the ancient Tamassus, occupies the
site of Ammochostos, one of the ten royal cities, which paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
tribute to Esarhaddon, and possesses the only harbour between
Salamis and Leuculla, and was probably the city called Arsinœ
under the Ptolemies.</p>

<p>“The city of Famagusta,” says Cesnola, “built by the Christians
eight hundred years ago, from the ruins of Salamis, and
destroyed by the Turks in 1571, after the terrible siege in which
the Venetian soldiers so heroically defended their position, once
counted its beautiful churches by hundreds and its palatial
residences by thousands. Once it had been one of the principal
commercial cities of the Levant, with a harbour, in which rode
large fleets, but which now, through neglect, has become filled
with sand, and is able only to float ships of light draught. It
was just outside the mouth of this closed harbour, that the
vessels containing the Venetian families and their most precious
personal and household effects were sunk by the faithless
Mustapha Pacha, after he had killed the Venetian generals.”</p>

<p>“As you approach the massive walls of the city, which are
nearly seventeen feet thick, and of solid stone, all taken from
the ruins of Salamis, you see how impossible it was to take such
a city except by famine or treachery. The walls stand now as
impregnable and intact as when raised by the Lusignans.”</p>

<p>“The old bronze guns of the Republic of Venice are still on the
bastions, in their original place, looking formidably towards
the sea, and the plain of Salamis, but spiked and out of service
since 1571. There are a half dozen rusty iron guns of Turkish
manufacture, pretty much in the same condition.”</p>

<p>“The ruins of Famagusta are not grand and imposing, yet
they are most beautiful and touching. It is impossible to
see the still existing walls of many of its fine mediæval churches,
with frescoes plainly visible in the interiors—here a rectory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
there evidences of elegant homes—without a feeling of intense
sadness. Only two out of the three hundred churches,
which are said to have existed in Famagusta, were left standing.
The principal one, formerly the cathedral and now used
as a mosque, is paved with mortuary marble slabs engraved
with the names and arms of Italian noblemen, once buried
beneath them, whose bones were exhumed, and thrown into the
sea, by order of the fanatical and ferocious Mustapha Pacha,
the day after he captured the city. The other church, used as
a granary and a stable by the Turks, contains also a few
tombstones, now all worn out by the horses’ hoofs. There I
discovered an inscription, recording the day on which, by
the abdication of Katharine Cornaro, the Venetians became the
rulers of Cyprus.”</p>

<p>“Within the city walls resides the caimakan<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> of the province
of Carpass, with the Cadi of Famagusta, and the usual mejilis.
There is also a military governor of the fortress, and a company
of artillery. This governor resides with his troops in a small
fort overlooking the sea, and flanked by a large round tower
called by the natives ‘Torre del Moro’ (Tower of the Moor).
Tradition asserts that in this tower were the head-quarters of
the Venetian Lord-Lieutenant of Cyprus, Cristoforo Moro,
during the years 1506 to 1508. In the latter year, on the 22nd
of October, Cristoforo Moro was recalled from Cyprus, and
returned to Venice; and from documents which I have been
allowed to peruse, it would appear that this man was married
four times, and that his private life was not very exemplary.
This Cristoforo Moro was the ‘Othello’ of Shakespeare.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span></p>
<p>“The fortress of Famagusta contained some of the worst
criminals of the Turkish Empire. Many of them are condemned
for life, others are sentenced to from fifteen to twenty-five
years’ imprisonment, and all are heavily shackled.”</p>

<p>The harbour of Famagusta would be excellent, if it were
cleared of the filth with which it is blocked up; but at present
it can only accommodate a few small vessels.</p>

<p>Limasol, on the south coast, is the most European town in
the island, and has a good harbour; but the old parts of the
town are a heap of ruins. It is still of considerable importance,
and is the chief place of export for the wines of the country,
which are much in demand in the Levant. The surrounding
country is rich in fruit trees, of which the carob-tree is the
most conspicuous.</p>

<p>Near the town formerly stood the Commandery of the Knights
Templars (Commandery of Kolossi), extending from Mount
Olympus to Baffo and Limasol.</p>

<p>Baffo, or New Paphos, was under the Romans the principal
town in the western part of the island, and is famous in ancient
poetry as the favourite residence of Aphrodite or Venus, and here
was her most celebrated temple.</p>

<p>During the reign of the Emperor Augustus, this town was
destroyed by an earthquake, and was afterwards rebuilt.</p>

<p>Here St. Paul converted Sergius Paulus, the Roman deputy-governor,
besides many others, preaching in the Jewish synagogues,
of which there were several.</p>

<p>Here Elymas, the sorcerer, was struck blind for endeavouring
to frustrate St. Paul’s attempts to Christianise the people.</p>

<p>The Church of St. Paul is the only Venetian building now
standing. Baffo has a small but unsafe port, and is the see of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
Greek bishop. Kerinia, Cerini, or Ghirneh, on the north coast,
has a harbour, from which a limited trade is carried on with the
opposite coast of Karamania. Its ruins would seem to indicate
that it was formerly a fine town. It is fortified, and the second
stronghold of the island, and like Lapethus (the original capital of
the district of Kerinia), is traced to the Dorian colonists, under
Praxander and Cepheus. This formed one of the royal cities
of the island. “I passed near this town,” says Cesnola, “several
times during my northern excursions, but never had the curiosity
to enter it. The village itself, with the exception of the citadel,
is a small dirty place, almost exclusively inhabited by Mussulmans,
who, with the garrison, enjoy a very bad reputation—second
only to that of their co-religionists at New Paphos. The
ancient site of Kerinia is a little to the west of the present town,
and more inland. For a considerable distance along the western
shore, there are to be seen here and there large caverns excavated
in the rock; some, though not all, seem to have been tombs.
South-east of the town, about an hour’s ride from it, and midway
up the mountains, stands an imposing mediæval ruin called
‘Lapais.’ It was an abbey, built by King Hugo the Third, and
belonged to the Latin Church, but was destroyed by the Turks
when they captured the fortress of Kerinia. It is a fact worth
noticing, that all the churches belonging to the Latins were
destroyed by the Turks when they took possession of the island.
In this I have no doubt they were gladly assisted, or at least
encouraged, by the Greeks, who detested the Franks even more
than the Turks. This abbey occupied one of the most picturesque
and lovely spots of the whole island; a large hall is still standing,
one hundred feet long, thirty-two feet wide, and about
forty feet high, which was probably the refectory of the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
abbots; beneath it is another apartment of like dimensions,
divided into two chambers, the vault of which is supported by
massive columns.”</p>

<p>“In the court-yard, piled the one upon the other, are two large
marble sarcophagi of late Roman work, one of which has garlands
of flowers, nude figures, and large bulls’ heads in bold
relief. Both bear evidence of having been used for a long time
as troughs. Upon the lintel, over the door of the great hall,
are engraved three shields; one represents the Jerusalem cross,
another the royal arms of the Lusignans, and the third a lion
rampant. The Gothic chapel of the abbey has been partly
repaired with sun-dried bricks and plaster, and is now used by
the Greeks, living in the neighbourhood, as their place of worship;
portions of the court-yard serve as their cemetery. On
two high peaks in this range of mountains stood two feudal
or royal castles, one called St. Hilarion, and the other Buffavento,
which served as state prisons and places of refuge to some of the
Latin kings of Cyprus. They were both dismantled by order of
the Venetian Admiral Prioli.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Climate.</span></h3>

<p>The climate is generally healthy excepting on some parts of
the coast, but this is entirely due to the neglected state of the
country; if the much-needed drainage was properly carried out
the most satisfactory result would ensue. As in most Eastern
countries, the rain falls at stated periods, commencing about the
middle of October and continuing until the end of April. After
June slight showers fall from time to time, but have little power
to modify the heat, which is, however, tempered occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
by a cool wind. In September the great heat sets in, but does
not continue for any length of time. At Larnaka, the mean
temperature in February is about 52 deg., and in August
81 deg. The winters are milder, and the summers cooler than
on the coast of Syria opposite.</p>

<p>The average rainfall is about fourteen inches in the year. Of
late years, droughts have been of frequent occurrence, owing, no
doubt, to the destruction of the woods and forests.</p>

<p>The north coast is liable to hot winds from the north-east,
from the desert of Arabia in the south-east, and in the south
and south-west from Egypt and Lybia.</p>

<p>Speaking of one of these winds, Dr. Clarke says, “We found
it so scorching that the skin instantly peeled from our lips; a
tendency to sneeze was excited, accompanied by great pains in
the eyes, and chapping of the hands and face. The mercury,
exposed to its full current, rose 6 deg. Fahrenheit in two
minutes—from 80 deg. to 86 deg.”</p>

<p>Dr. Unger says, that it is so hot in summer as to make
occupation irksome, and so cold in winter that the absence of
spring and autumn makes the transition, from one extreme to
the other, very sudden. The climate is, of course, cooler in the
more mountainous portion of the west, than in the flat eastern
side, where the temperature in the height of summer amounts to
90 deg. in the shade; during the winter, in the lower parts of
the land, it seldom falls to freezing point. During October,
November, and December the rain falls, and entirely ceases
during the summer, when there is generally a blue sky over
the island. The drier the summer, the damper the winter;
and sometimes it then rains for forty days together. At such
periods the thirsty land recovers itself. On the other hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
there are winters when no rain falls, and drought is severely
felt during the summer. In the time of Constantine, we are
told that no rain fell on the island for thirty-six years.</p>

<p>By the middle of May the harvest is over, and wherever the
eye rests the grass is withered and parched. The temperature
now reaches 80 deg. in the shade, and sometimes, in the
middle of the day is even higher; the atmosphere grows thick,
and a veil seems to fall over all surrounding objects; all rivers
are dry; the dew ceases in June or July, and the hot winds,
make the air more oppressive; finally come hosts of annoying
insects, from which one may seek in vain to escape. At
this season, all work is done in the evening and at night.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Population.</span></h3>

<p>The number of inhabitants is very uncertain. It is variously
estimated between 100,000 and 250,000 souls, of whom 40,000
to 60,000 are Mohammedans, including the Linopambagi or
“men of linen and cotton,” as they are called in derision, who
outwardly conforming to the tenets of Mohammed, are in
reality Christians. The majority of the people belong to the
Greek Church, and the remainder are either Armenians or
Maronites, whose peculiar religion we will endeavour to describe.
These number about 2800.</p>

<p>The Maronites are a tribe of people inhabiting the western
declivity of Mount Lebanon, and figure in history as a sect of
Christians. By adopting the Monothelitic doctrine soon after
it had been condemned, in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 680, by the Council of Constantinople,
they came to be distinguished as a distinct religious party,
and having as their first bishop, a certain monk, John Maro, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
were called Maronites. Maro assumed the title of “Patriarch
of Antioch,” and asserted the ecclesiastical independence of the
tribe.</p>

<p>This sect defended their freedom first against the Greeks, and
afterwards against the Saracens. At length, in 1182, they renounced
the opinions of the Monothelites, and were re-admitted
within the pale of the Romish Church; the terms of reconciliation
being that the religious tenets, moral precepts, and
ancient rites of the country should remain unaltered. The
Maronites adopted no Popish opinion, except the supremacy of
the Roman Pontiff. By this slight tie they still continue
united to the Church of Rome. In return for their imperfect
allegiance, the Pope is obliged to defray the expenses of their
public worship and to maintain a college at Rome for the education
of their priests. He has the power of sanctioning the appointment
of their patriarch, after he has been selected by their
bishops. This dignitary has his head-quarters in the monastery
of Lebanon, and holds the title of Patriarch of Antioch, and
by adopting the name of Peter, claims to be the successor of
that apostle. Like the bishops who compose his synod, he is
bound to remain in perpetual celibacy, a law, however, which the
rest of the clergy do not observe. The Maronite monks are of
the order of St. Anthony, and live in monasteries scattered
among the mountain solitudes.</p>

<p>Slavery exists, but owing to the increasing poverty of the
Turks, the number of slaves is very much diminished.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Character of the Inhabitants.</span></h3>

<p>Herr von Löher describes the bulk of the population as devoid
all energy, of sluggish temperament, and obstinately addicted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
to ancient customs. They are powerful, hospitable, and exceedingly
amiable in their domestic relations. The women are very
good housewives and very active. The girls are full of life,
especially on festive occasions, are fond of gaudy colours, and
dress very fantastically.</p>

<p>Elementary schools are established in all the larger villages,
and others of superior class in the three principal towns of the
island. The Greek bishops and many of the popes have been
educated in these latter, or at Athens, and are generally men
of culture; but most of the village priests and monks are as
ignorant as the peasants amongst whom their lives are past.</p>

<p>Greek is the language used throughout Cyprus, and has even
found its way into many of the Turkish houses.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Agriculture.</span></h3>

<p>The cultivation of the country appears to be in a very primitive
condition, and owing to the lightness and fertility of the soil
but slight labour is required in producing the necessary crops.
The cultivable surface of the island is estimated at 2,500,000
acres, of which not more than 130,000 acres are under tillage.
The annual average yield of corn is said not to exceed 120,000
quarters, and we are told that the disposal of the whole has been
a monopoly between the Turkish mulasallin and the Greek archbishop,
who either export or retail it at an arbitrary price. The
vegetation resembles that of the other islands of the Mediterranean.
There is no meadow land, but a great deal of waste,
which is either quite bare, or only covered with heather and
aromatic plants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Natural Productions.</span></h3>

<p>The principal productions are cotton, hemp, silk, corn, opium,
tobacco, turpentine, liquorice, madder, several dye-woods, gum-tragacinth,
and colocynth. Fruits of all kind, in particular grapes,
oranges, lemons, pomegranates, olives, walnuts, figs, mulberries,
apricots, &amp;c.; the carob-tree (<i>Ceratonia siliqua</i>) abounds in
some districts. There were once extensive plantations of sugar-cane.
Large quantities of fine vegetables are grown. Cyprus
was celebrated for roses; hyacinths, anemones, ranunculuses,
narcissus, poppies, &amp;c., grow wild. Trees and shrubs of all
kinds grow luxuriantly, including pines, firs, cypresses, ashes,
oaks, beeches, elms, myrtles, evergreens, oleanders, &amp;c.</p>

<p>One of the most important plants of the island is the Ferula
Græca; of the stalks of which the Cypriotes form a great part
of their household furniture, and the pith is used instead of
tinder for conveying fire from one place to another.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Manufactures.</span></h3>

<p>Wines of three kinds are made, namely, Commanderia, Muscadine,
and Mavro. Cotton, silk, and woollen goods of various
qualities are manufactured on a small scale. Olive oil, pitch,
resin, cheese, raisins, and pottery (for home consumption) are
also made. Nikosia is noted for its Morocco leather. The
peasantry distil rose, orange, and lavender waters, myrtle and
laudanum oil.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Minerals and Precious Stones.</span></h3>

<p>Cyprus is rich in metals and minerals, including copper, silver,
malachite, lead, and quicksilver. There are also quarries of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
asbestos, talc, sulphur, red jasper, agate, rock crystal, and
marble. Soda is also found. The salt works, near Larnaka,
produce a revenue of 20,000<i>l.</i> per annum. Gold is occasionally
met with in the streams. Diamonds, emeralds, opals, amethysts,
and other precious stones are sometimes found.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Natural History.</span></h3>

<p>The principal animals in the island are oxen, sheep, and goats,
which thrive well and are abundant. The most common of the
wild animals are the fox, hare, and wild-cat. The hare feeds on
fragrant herbs, which impart a most agreeable flavour to its
flesh. All the birds that winter in Africa are to be found in
Cyprus. Beccaficos and ortolans are very common and remarkably
plump. Water-fowl are very numerous; game, such
as partridges, quails, woodcock, and snipe, very plentiful.</p>

<p>Serpents of various species are commonly met with; these are
stated to be, we believe erroneously, poisonous.</p>

<p>Dr. Clarke states that tarantulas, having black bodies covered
with hair and bright yellow eyes, are not uncommon. A
large venomous spider is sometimes seen, called by Sonnini, the
Galcode of the Levant; its body, which is about an inch long, is
a bright yellow, and covered with long hairs; this creature runs
with extraordinary swiftness; its bite rarely produces death,
but causes acute pain. The extent to which Cyprus was
formerly devastated by locusts has been spoken of in another
chapter. Bees are kept in great numbers in many parts of the
island. Of these Dr. Clarke gives the following interesting
account:</p>

<p>Speaking of the village of Attién, he says, “In these little
cottages we found very large establishments for bees, but all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
honey thus made is demanded by the governor; so that an apiary
is only considered as the cause of an additional tax. The manner,
however, in which the honey is collected is curious, and worthy
of imitation, and it merits a particular description: the contrivance
is simple, and was doubtless suggested by the more
ancient custom still existing in the Crimea, of harbouring bees
in cylindrical hives made from the bark of trees. They build
up a wall formed entirely of earthen cylinders, each about
three feet in length, placed one above the other horizontally,
and closed at their extremities with mortar. This wall is then
covered with a shed, and upwards of one hundred hives may
thus be maintained within a very small compass.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Revenue.</span></h3>

<p>Herr Löher found it difficult to obtain trustworthy information
respecting the revenue of the island. The best estimate
obtainable calculated it at about sixteen and a half millions of
piastres. Half a million of this, being derived from a consideration
paid by Christians for exemption from military service,
would have to be immediately surrendered by a Christian
Government. Three, at least, of the remaining imposts, yielding
an estimated return of two millions of piastres, are so
execrable in principle that they ought to be abandoned with the
least possible delay. These are the capitation tax on sheep, and
the export duties on wine and silk. It is satisfactory to learn,
on the other hand, that the annual cost of administration is not
supposed to exceed at present from two to three millions of
piastres, the balance of the revenue being confiscated by certain
high functionaries now discharged; and that the apparent re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>ceipts
do not represent the amount actually collected from the
population, seeing that they have to pay half as much again in
bribes. These abuses will henceforth cease; the customs revenue
will be largely augmented by importations on account of the
occupying force, and from the stimulus given to commerce in
general; and it may even be possible, by prudent diplomacy, to
make the <i>vacouf</i>, or Mohammedan ecclesiastical property, contribute
its fair share towards the expenses of the State.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Sketch of General History.</span></h3>

<p>According to Josephus, Cyprus was first colonised by Cittim,
a grandson of Japhet, who settled in the island, and founded
Chittim, in emulation of his brother Tarshish, who had built
the town of Tarsus, on the opposite coast of Cilicia. The
Phœnicians, it is supposed, invaded Cyprus at a very early date,
and retained possession of the whole, or a portion of the island,
until the reign of Solomon. Greek colonists also settled on the
coast. Herodotus states that Amasis, King of Egypt, invaded
Cyprus, and took Citium (Herod., ii. 162). The island then
submitted to the Persians, and afterwards surrendered to
Alexander the Great, on whose death it fell, with Egypt, to the
share of Ptolemy Soter, “the son of Lagus.” Having overcome
Cyrene, which had revolted, Ptolemy (b.c. 313) crossed over to
Cyprus to punish the kings of the various little states upon
that island for having joined Antigonus, one of Alexander’s
generals. Demetrius, son of Antigonus, conquered the fleet
of Ptolemy near the island of Cyprus, took 1600 men prisoners
and sunk 200 ships.</p>

<p>Now that the fate of empires was to be settled by naval<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
battles, the friendship of Cyprus became very important to the
neighbouring states. The large and safe harbours gave to this
island a great value in the naval warfare between Phœnicia
and Asia Minor. Alexander had given it as his opinion that
the command of the Mediterranean went with the island of
Cyprus, and called it the key to Egypt. Under the Ptolemies
Cyprus continued sometimes united to Egypt and sometimes
governed by a separate prince of that dynasty. The last of
these princes, brother to Ptolemy Auletes, King of Egypt,
incurred the enmity of P. Clodius Pulcher, a Roman of illustrious
family, who being taken prisoner by Cilician pirates, sent
to the King of Cyprus for money to pay his ransom; the king
sent an insufficient sum, and Clodius having recovered his
liberty obtained a decree, as soon as he became tribune, for
making Cyprus a Roman province. Marcus Cato, against
whom he had a bitter enmity, was sent to take possession of
the new territory, and achieved this difficult undertaking with
unexpected success. The king, in despair at the attempt upon
his kingdom, committed suicide. Cato at once seized upon the
treasury and sent a large booty home. Cyprus thus became a
Roman province, and on the division of that empire was allotted
to the Byzantines, and long formed one of the brightest jewels
of the imperial crown. At length, after many successive changes,
it again became a separate principality, under a branch of the
house of Comnena, from which it was finally wrested by
the adventurous hand of Richard Cœur de Lion, who sold it to the
Knights Templars. The new government proved so oppressive
that the people were driven to open revolt, and Richard, having
resumed the sovereignty, placed the crown, in 1192, upon the
head of Guy de Lusignan, ex-king of Jerusalem.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span></p>
<p>John the Third, of Lusignan, died in 1458, leaving the kingdom
to Charlotte, his only legitimate child, who married her
cousin Louis, Count of Geneva, second son of the Duke of
Savoy and of Anna of Cyprus. She was solemnly crowned at
Likosia in 1460, but was soon afterwards expelled by her natural
brother James, assisted by the Mamelukes of Egypt. James
married Katharine Cornaro, the daughter of a Venetian merchant,
who brought him a dowry of 100,000 golden ducats. On
this occasion the Venetian Senate adopted Katharine Cornaro as
daughter of St. Mark, and the marriage was celebrated in 1471.
In 1473 James died, and his wife, soon after, was delivered of a
son, of whom the Republic of Venice assumed the guardianship,
and the Venetian troops were sent to garrison the towns of the
island. The child dying whilst an infant, the Senate persuaded
Katharine, in 1489, to abdicate the sovereignty in favour of the
Republic, and to retire to Asolo, near Treviso, where she passed
the rest of her days in a princely style on a liberal pension.
Meantime, Charlotte Lusignan had retired to Rome, where she
died in 1487, bequeathing her claims to Charles, Duke of Savoy,
in consequence of which the sovereigns of that dynasty assume
to this day the title of “Kings of Jerusalem and Cyprus.”</p>

<p>The Venetians kept possession of Cyprus till 1470, when
Selim the Second sent a powerful force to invade the island.
The Turks took Likosia by storm and massacred about 20,000
people. From that time until now the Turks have remained in
possession of Cyprus.</p>
